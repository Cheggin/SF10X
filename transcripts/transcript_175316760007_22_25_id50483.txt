MADAM CLERK LET'S GO TO OUR 230 SPECIAL ORDER. >> IT IS NOW TIME TO RECOGNIZE THOSE WHO DESERVE WHO DESERVE RECOGNITION FOR MERITORIOUS SERVICE TO THE CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO. AND WE WILL BEGIN WITH DISTRICT SIX SUPERVISOR DORSEY THANK YOU, PRESIDENT MANDOLIN COLLEAGUES. >> IT IS WITH IMMENSE GRATITUDE AND ADMIRATION THAT I TODAY RECOGNIZE SOMEONE WHO HAS MADE AN INDELIBLE IMPACT ON THE NEIGHBORHOODS OF DISTRICT SIX IN OUR CITY AS A WHOLE. >> COMMANDER LUKE MARTIN UNTIL RECENTLY CAPTAIN LUKE MARTIN ON HIS WELL-EARNED PROMOTION WITHIN THE SAN FRANCISCO POLICE DEPARTMENT. >> FOR THOSE OF US WHO WORK CLOSELY WITH HIM, THIS IS BOTH A PROUD AND BITTERSWEET MOMENT . COMMANDER MARTIN STEPPED INTO HIS LEADERSHIP AT SOUTHERN STATION DURING ONE OF THE MOST CHALLENGING TIMES IN RECENT MEMORY FOR NEIGHBORHOODS LIKE SOMA, THE EAST CUT AND RINCON HILL. IN FACT, HIS TENURE AS SOUTHERN DISTRICT CAPTAIN CLOSELY MATCHED MY OWN TENURE AS SUPERVISOR FROM DISTRICT SIX WHICH ACCOUNTS FOR MOST OF THE SOUTHERN POLICE DISTRICT. FROM DAY ONE, CAPTAIN MARTIN LED WITH PROFESSIONALISM, INTEGRITY AND A RELENTLESS COMMITMENT TO COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AND PUBLIC SAFETY. HE DIDN'T JUST SHOW UP. HE WAS PRESENT WHETHER IT WAS AN EARLY MORNING CHECK IN FOLLOWING AN OVERNIGHT INCIDENT OR A CALL FROM A CONCERNED CONSTITUENT. HE MADE SURE MY OFFICE NEVER FACED CHALLENGES ALONE OR UNINFORMED AND HE BROUGHT WITH HIM NOT JUST RESPONSIVENESS BUT HIS DEEP EXPERIENCE. COMMANDER MARTIN HAS SERVED IN THE SAN FRANCISCO POLICE DEPARTMENT SINCE 1998, FOLLOWING IN HIS FATHER'S FOOTSTEPS AND CARRYING FORWARD A LEGACY OF SERVICE. OVER THE YEARS HE'S WORKED TO PATROL IN THE MISSION IN BAYVIEW. HE LED GANG INVESTIGATIONS AND HE SERVED IN NIGHT INVESTIGATIONS AND THE TRAFFIC COMPANY. HIS BREADTH OF EXPERIENCE IS MATCHED ONLY BY HIS DEDICATION . NOW I FIRST WORKED WITH LUKE WHEN HE WAS LIEUTENANT BUT IT WAS AS CAPTAIN OF SOUTHERN STATION BEGINNING IN 2022 THAT COMMANDER MARTIN'S LEADERSHIP TRULY BECAME PERSONAL FOR SO MANY OF US AS RESIDENTS OF NEIGHBORHOODS THAT WERE BESET BY DRUG DRIVEN LAWLESSNESS AND ASSOCIATED CHALLENGES. AT LEVELS WE HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE IN SOMA IN THE EAST CUT IN MISSION BAY IN RINCON HILL AND ACROSS DISTRICT SIX HE DIDN'T JUST ENFORCE THE LAW HE WAS A WELL-INFORMED AND HIGHLY RESPONSIVE PUBLIC SAFETY LEADER. HE EARNED THE COMMUNITY'S TRUST THROUGH HIS PATIENT AND CALM DEMEANOR. HIS GENUINE EMPATHY AND HIS GOOD HEART AND HE NEVER WAITED TO BE ASKED. HE CALLED US. HE ASKED HOW HE COULD HELP AND HE ALWAYS SHOWED UP QUIETLY, RELIABLY AND WITHOUT FANFARE. HE WAS A FAMILIAR FAMILIAR FACE AT COMMUNITY MEETINGS, A TRUSTED PARTNER TO LOCAL BUSINESSES AND A STEADY HAND DURING SOME OF THE MOST DIFFICULT PUBLIC SAFETY CHALLENGES MY DISTRICT FACED. HE LISTENED. HE FOLLOWED THROUGH AND IN NEIGHBORHOODS THAT TOO OFTEN FEEL NEGLECTED. >> HE MADE SURE THAT THE RESIDENTS OF DISTRICT SIX FEEL SEEN, HEARD AND PROTECTED. HE REMINDED SO MANY OF US AS SAN FRANCISCANS THAT SAN FRANCISCO'S POLICE DEPARTMENT HAS OUR BACK. NOW AS AN ELECTED POLITICIAN I WILL CONFESS I AM NOT ALWAYS COMFORTABLE WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE MORE POPULAR IN MY DISTRICT THAN I AM. BUT WHEN THAT PERSON IS CAPTAIN LUKE BARTON NOW COMMANDER LUKE MARTIN, I'M OKAY WITH IT. AS HE STEPS INTO HIS NEW ROLE AS COMMANDER OF THE SPECIAL OPERATIONS BUREAU, I HAVE EVERY CONFIDENCE THAT HE WILL CARRY FORWARD THE SAME VALUES THAT DEFINED HIS LEADERSHIP IN SOUTHERN COMPASSION ACCOUNTABILITY, RESPONSIBILITY, RESPONSIVENESS AND INTEGRITY. AND I'M CONFIDENT HE WILL BE EVERY BIT AS POPULAR CITYWIDE AS HE WAS IN DISTRICT SIX. COMMANDER MARTIN, ON BEHALF OF THE SAN FRANCISCO BOARD OF SUPERVISORS HEARS AND TOO FROM ALL OF YOUR FANS IN DISTRICT SIX WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP, YOUR PARTNERSHIP AND YOUR EXTRAORDINARY SERVICE. WE CONGRATULATE YOU ON YOUR NEXT CHAPTER. >> WE WE AND WE JUST GOT IT DONE AND WE BESTOW UPON YOU THAT PRESTIGIOUS AND UNIVERSALLY ACKNOWLEDGED AWARD FOR EXCELLENCE IN THE FIELD OF POLICING. DONUTS. >> NOW BEFORE YOU SPEAK, I UNDERSTAND THAT MICHELLE DELANEY FROM MALONE LEVIN MILLER WOULD ALSO LIKE TO SPEAK. SO MICHELLE, WHY DON'T YOU TAKE THE FLOOR? >> LET'S START. THANK YOU. SUPERVISOR DORSEY. HELLO. MY NAME IS MICHELLE DELANEY REPRESENTING THE COMMUNITY POLICE ADVISORY BOARD TO HONOR AND SUPPORT THE PROMOTION OF CAPTAIN LUKE, MARK AND MARTIN. A LEADER A PARTNER AND A TRUE PILLAR OF OUR COMMUNITY. FOR THOSE OF US WHO HAVE HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF WORKING ALONGSIDE HIM WHETHER THROUGH THE POLICE ADVISORY BOARD, LOCAL BUSINESSES OR NEIGHBORHOOD ESTABLISHMENTS ONE THING IS ABUNDANTLY CLEAR CAPTAIN MARTIN EMBODIES WHAT IT MEANS TO SERVE WITH INTEGRITY, COMPASSION AND UNWAVERING DEDICATION. FROM THE VERY BEGINNING, CAPTAIN MARTIN APPROACHED EVERY CONVERSATION, EVERY CHALLENGE AND EVERY COLLABORATION WITH MUTUAL RESPECT. HE DIDN'T JUST LISTEN. HE ENGAGED. HE DIDN'T JUST ACKNOWLEDGE DIVERSE PERSPECTIVES. HE VALUED THEM IN A CITY AS DYNAMIC AND COMPLEX IN SAN FRANCISCO. HIS ABILITY TO OFFER REAL DIALOG EVEN ON TOUGH ISSUES HELPED BUILD BRIDGES WHERE OTHERS MIGHT HAVE SEEN DIVIDES. CAPTAIN MARTIN'S LEADERSHIP GAVE PROFOUND MEANING TO THE PHRASE CIVIL SERVICE. HE UNDERSTOOD THAT TRUST ISN'T GIVEN BUT EARNED THROUGH CONSTANT ACTION AND TIME AGAIN FOLLOWED THROUGH WHETHER IT WAS STRENGTHENING THE NEIGHBORHOOD POLICE RELATIONS ADVOCATING FOR EQUITABLE SOLUTIONS OR SIMPLY SHOWING UP WITH AN OPEN MIND. HE MADE A LASTING IMPACT. THE CPR RECOMMENDS THAT CAPTAIN MARTIN IS REWARDED WITH A WELL-DESERVED PROMOTION TO COMMANDER. THANK YOU. >> THANK YOU, MICHEL.

YOU'LL SEE ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE A FEW EXAMPLES OF BEFORE AND AFTER PHOTOS OF OUR PROJECTS. >> OUR PROJECTS RANGE FROM ANYTHING FROM SMALL TO LARGE THE TOP ONE YOU SEE WHAT WE'VE DONE WITH AN OVERGROWN SIDEWALK WHERE WEEDS HAVE TAKEN OVER AND HOW WE'VE ENHANCED IT AND THEN WE ALSO HAVE SOME FREEWAY OVERPASSES AND SIDE LOTS TO THE FREEWAYS THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO ENHANCE ON THE RIGHT SIDE ARE A FEW STATS THAT I'D LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT AND PART OF THE GREEN BENEFIT DISTRICT WHAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO BEEN ABLE TO ACHIEVE IN THE PAST TEN YEARS WHEN WE WERE FIRST FOUNDED ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO THERE ONLY TWO ACRES OF PUBLIC GREEN SPACE IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD WITH THE BEAUTY WE HAVE MORE THAN TRIPLED THAT AMOUNT OF SPACE TO SEVEN ACRES IN HOW HAVE WE DONE THAT? WHAT'S OUR FUNDING LOOK LIKE? WELL THROUGH OUR ANNUAL PROPERTY ASSESSMENTS OF ABOUT $5 MILLION WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO RAISE AN ADDITIONAL $6 MILLION THROUGH PRIVATE DONATIONS, GRANTS ETC. SO THAT'S ABOUT 21 MILLION DOLLARS DIRECTLY INVESTED INTO OUR COMMUNITY BUY IN THROUGH THE GREEN BENEFIT DISTRICT SINCE OUR INCEPTION. LIKE I MENTIONED, WE WERE ESTABLISHED IN 2016 ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO AND I'M HERE TODAY TO PURSUE ANOTHER 15 YEAR TERM TO TAKE US THROUGH 2040 AS PART OF THIS RENEWAL WE'VE DECIDED TO SLIGHTLY INCREASE OUR BOUNDARIES WHICH I'LL TOUCH ON A LITTLE BIT MORE IN A LATER SLIDE. BUT ULTIMATELY I'M HERE BECAUSE WE WANT TO CONTINUE THE GREAT WORK THAT WE'VE DONE AND OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL MINUTES I'LL TAKE YOU THROUGH HOW WE CREATE ,MAINTAIN AND ENHANCE OUR PUBLIC SPACES, HOW WE ENGAGE OUR COMMUNITY AND HOW WE ACTIVATE OUR PARKS. SO HOW DO WE ENGAGE OUR COMMUNITY? WE CONSISTENTLY HOLD VOLUNTEER EVENTS. >> THIS INCLUDES PLANTING DAYS WHICH ON THE BOTTOM TO PICTURES YOU CAN SEE THAT THEY ARE VERY WELL ATTENDED BY OUR COMMUNITY AND THEN WE ALSO HOLD EVENTS WITH OTHER NEIGHBORHOOD ORGANIZATIONS. THERE'S A LOT OF ACRONYMS ON THERE. DOGPATCH NEIGHBORHOOD ASSOCIATION AND POTRERO BOOSTERS NEIGHBORHOOD ASSOCIATION AND ONE OF THE EVENTS THAT WE PARTNER WITH DEANA WITH THE DOGPATCH NEIGHBORHOOD ASSOCIATION IS OUR ANNUAL HALLOWEEN SLOW STREET. WE CALL IT A SPOOKY STROLL. WE WORK ON CLOSING A COUPLE BLOCKS OF OUR SLOW STREET IN DOGPATCH SO KIDS CAN TRICK OR TREAT AND ROAM FREELY AND THAT'S THE BOTTOM LEFT PHOTO THERE. AND THEN ANOTHER WAY THAT WE ACTIVATE OUR PARKS IN THESE SPACES THAT WE CREATE IS THROUGH OUR ANNUAL DOGPATCH MUSIC SERIES. WE ARE DOING IT AGAIN THIS FALL. IT'S FOUR SEPARATE DAYS IN THE FALL AND ANOTHER EVENT CLOSER TO EARTH DAY IN THE SPRING WHERE WE HAVE A BAND, A LIVE BAND PEOPLE COME AND ENJOY THESE SPACES THAT WE'VE CREATED AND THAT'S THAT TOP LEFT PHOTO THERE. LOCAL BUSINESSES COME OUT. WE HAVE A FEW MUSEUMS HERE IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD AND IT'S PRETTY WELL ATTENDED. >> ANOTHER MAJOR PART OF WHAT WE DO IN THE GREEN BENEFIT DISTRICT IS MAINTENANCE. WE WORK WITH A LANDSCAPE MAINTENANCE CONTRACTOR PROVIDING PARK AND OPEN SPACE MANAGEMENT. >> THIS INCLUDES WEEDING, PRUNING, WATERING, IRRIGATION MAINTENANCE ETC. AMONG OTHER THINGS AND THEN AND OFTEN OVERLOOKED BUT IMPORTANT PART OF WHAT WE DO IS DOG WASTE MAINTENANCE AND PROVIDING DOGGIE BAGS TO OUR COMMUNITY IN OUR PARKS. >> THE FUN FACT SINCE THE INCEPTION OF THE DVD WE HAVE DISTRIBUTED OVER 58,000 DOGGIE BAGS. >> IT'S ABOUT 160 A DAY IF YOU DO THE MATH AND THAT IS A LOT OF DOG. ANOTHER ASPECT I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT ABOUT THE GREEN BENEFIT DISTRICT AND WHAT WE DO WE CONTRACT WITH ANOTHER VENDOR AND PART OF WHAT WE DO IS REMOVE LITTER GARBAGE AND MAKE SURE OUR PARKS AND OUR PLACES, OUR SIDEWALKS ARE FREE OF LITTER, THEY'RE CLEAN, THEY'RE ACCESSIBLE AND OUR NEIGHBORS ARE ABLE TO USE THEM. WE SPARKLING FURNITURE WE MAKE SURE EVERYTHING IS WORKING, LIGHTING ETC. AND IN DOING THIS WE SUPPLEMENT DPW EFFORTS FOR CLEANER SPACES FOR ILLEGAL DUMPING, FOR OVERFLOWING GARBAGE CANS. AND THEN ANOTHER ASPECT OF WHAT WE DO IS GRAFFITI ABATEMENT. WITHIN TWO DAYS OF IDENTIFYING GRAFFITI IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD WE HAVE IT REMOVED AND THEN ON TO THE EXCITING PART OF WHAT THE GREEN BENEFIT DISTRICT DOES WE AS PART OF THE NEXT 15 YEARS WE JUST WANT TO CONTINUE DEVELOPING NEW PROJECTS. WE HAVE A VERY ROBUST PROJECT PIPELINE. WE HAVE A LONG LIST PROBABLY OVER 20 DIFFERENT PROJECTS BIG AND SMALL THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE WORKING ON. THEY COULD BE ANYTHING FROM SIDEWALK GARDENS, NEW LIGHTING BENCHES, THEY COULD BE COMMUNITY GARDENS AND SO THAT IS WHY I'M HERE TODAY ON THIS SLIDE I MENTIONED EARLIER AS PART OF THIS RENEWAL THIS NEW CHARTER FOR 15 YEARS WE ARE SLIGHTLY EXPANDING OUR BOUNDARIES ON THE LEFT SIDE AND BLUE YOU WILL SEE THE EXISTING DOGPATCH BOUNDARY AND ON HIGHLIGHT IN THE BOTTOM LEFT IS THE YELLOW IS THE EXPANSION BOUNDARY AND DOGPATCH ON THE RIGHT SIDE THE GREEN IS OUR EXISTING NORTHWEST POTRERO HILL BOUNDARIES AND ON THE BOTTOM IN ORANGE IS OUR PROPOSED EXPANSION. OUR RENEWAL COMMITTEE SPENT ABOUT SIX MONTHS DISCUSSING EXPANSION. DO WE WANT TO EXPAND SHOULD WE EXPAND IS A SUSTAINABLE IS A VIABLE AND MOST IMPORTANTLY ARE WE WANTED THERE? DO OUR NEIGHBORS WANT US TO EXPAND INTO THESE AREAS AND THAT IS HOW WE ENDED UP CHOOSING THESE DIFFERENT PARCELS TO EXPAND INTO THIS SLIDE SHOWS ALL OF OUR DIFFERENT PROJECTS PARKS THEY RANGE AGAIN FROM BIG OR SMALL SOME OF THESE WERE EXISTING MORE THAN TEN YEARS AGO AND GREEN BENEFIT DISTRICT HAS COME IN AND HELPED ENHANCE THEM AND MAINTAIN THESE PROJECTS BUT REALLY SOMETHING I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT IN THIS SLIDE IS FREEWAYS. >> IT IS RARELY LOOKED AT AS A GOOD THING OR CONSIDERED A GOOD THING WHEN FREEWAYS RUN THROUGH YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD AND IN OUR AREA WE ACTUALLY HAVE TWO FREEWAYS. THE GREAT THING THAT THE GREEN BENEFIT DISTRICT DISTRICT HAS BEEN ABLE TO ACHIEVE IS IS TURN THAT INTO A GOOD THING. >> A LOT OF THIS LAND ADJACENT TO THE FREEWAYS IS UNABLE TO BE DEVELOPED AND INSTEAD OF MAKING IT A PLACE TO AVOID WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CREATE PARKS, CREATE THEM SPACES THAT PEOPLE WANT TO ACTUALLY GATHER IN AND MAKE THEM FEEL WELCOME INTO OUR COMMUNITY. YOU'LL SEE JUST IF YOU LOOK AT THE FREEWAYS JUST HOW MANY OF OUR PARKS ARE DIRECTLY ADJACENT TO THEM AND OF COURSE BUDGET. THIS IS A SNAPSHOT OF THIS YEAR'S BUDGET YOU'LL SEE OUR FISCAL BUDGET IS ABOUT $900,000, 75% OF WHICH IS SPENT ON MAINTENANCE AND CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS. SO WE TRY TO SPEND AS MUCH AS WE POSSIBLY CAN DIRECTLY INTO WHAT OUR NEIGHBORS AND OUR COMMUNITY CAN CAN SEE IN REAL TIME AND AGAIN TO TIE BACK INTO THAT FIRST SLIDE, THIS IS OUR BUDGET, OUR ASSESSMENTS, WE TAKE OUR ASSESSMENT DOLLARS AND WE TRY TO TYPICALLY TRIPLE THAT AMOUNT OF MONEY THROUGH GRANTS AND PRIVATE DONATIONS. >> AND FINALLY WE WANTED TO SHOW OFF SOME BEAUTIFUL PICTURES OF OUR PARKS AND WHAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO ACHIEVE OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS. BUT OVERALL, YOU KNOW, I'M HERE BECAUSE I'M VERY PROUD TO BE PART OF THE GREEN BENEFIT DISTRICT AND THE WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS AND I HOPE WE GET TO CONTINUE OUR POSITIVE MOMENTUM FOR ANOTHER 15 AND I'M HERE TO TO ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. >> THANK YOU. THANK YOU. I DON'T SEE ANY COLLEAGUES IN THE QUEUE SO I THINK THAT WE CAN GO TO PUBLIC COMMENT. MADAM CLERK GREAT. LET'S OPEN PUBLIC COMMENT FOR THIS HEARING AND EVERY SPEAKER WILL HAVE TWO MINUTES AND THIS IS NOT GENERAL PUBLIC COMMENT. THIS IS JUST PUBLIC COMMENT ON THESE ON THESE TWO ITEMS. >> THE GREEN BENEFIT DISTRICT. HOLD ON A MINUTE. IS THIS PUBLIC COMMENT FOR THE PUBLIC OR WHAT? >> I WANT TO KNOW, JEFFREY, THIS IS PUBLIC COMMENT FOR THE GREEN BENEFIT DISTRICT ONLY. WELCOME TO THE FIRST SPEAKER. >> THIS ONE YES, HI. MY NAME IS CATHERINE DOMINE. I HAVE LIVED IN DOGPATCH FOR NEARLY 30 YEARS AND HAVE WATCHED THE COMMUNITY TRANSFORM FROM 800 NEIGHBORS AND 2000 CLIMBING TO OVER 6000 TODAY DOGPATCH WELCOMES GROWTH AND CHANGE, ESPECIALLY GRASSROOTS NEIGHBORHOOD DRIVEN PROJECTS. WE ALSO RECOGNIZE WHAT IT TAKES TO BRING TOGETHER AN EXTREMELY MULTICULTURAL NEIGHBORHOOD MADE UP OF NEWBORNS, SENIORS AND EVERYONE IN BETWEEN THE GPD TICKS ALL THESE BOXES A UNIQUE HOMEGROWN GREEN CBD COMBINING GREEN SPACE STREET ACTIVATIONS AND COMMUNITY BUILDING ALL ADMINISTERED BY VOLUNTEER BOARD MEMBERS LIKE ME. WE HAVE ACCOMPLISHED TOO MUCH IN THE PAST TEN YEARS BUT WITH A STILL GROWING COMMUNITY AND THE GB SUPPORT IT IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER BEFORE. WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT AND RENEWAL. THANK YOU. >> THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS. LET'S HEAR FROM OUR NEXT SPEAKER ON THE GREEN BENEFIT DISTRICT. >> YEAH THAT GREEN WITHIN. >> HEAR ANYTHING ABOUT GROWING FOOD IN THE PARKS? >> WELL OKAY KEEP GOING. YOU KNOW YOU JUST FEEDING A FOOD FEEDING THE AGENDA OF PEDOPHILES. THE MORE YOU WATCH THEM THE MORE YOU BECOME. WANT US TO WATCH OUT? >> ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. SO THAT THE BOARD DOES NOT ENDORSE THAT COMMENT. >> BUT LET'S HEAR FROM OUR NEXT SPEAKER PLEASE. HI, MY NAME'S SUSAN HASLUCK. I'VE LIVED IN DOGPATCH FOR ABOUT 29 YEARS AND I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT THE GBD IS THE MOST POSITIVE IMPACT THAT HAS HAPPENED IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD THE WHOLE TIME I'VE LIVED THERE AND THAT'S IN ADDITION TO THE TIP LINE. SO I JUST HOPE THAT YOU SUPPORT THIS AS WE DO. THANKS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENT. >> WELCOME TO THE NEXT SPEAKER. HELLO, I'M RICHARD ROMERO. I MOVED INTO THE SAN FRANCISCO AREA ABOUT FOUR YEARS AGO AND ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS I DID IS I MET WITH MY SUPERVISOR WALTON AND ASKED THEM WHAT ORGANIZATIONS SHOULD I BE INVOLVED WITH? AND HE GAVE ME A LIST AND AS A RESULT OF THAT I LEARNED ABOUT THE GREEN BENEFIT DISTRICT AND I WAS TOTALLY AMAZE IS THAT THIS CONCEPT OF TAKING UNUSABLE SPACE THAT IS BEEN NEGLECTED AND TURNED INTO BEAUTIFUL USABLE SPACE FOR PEOPLE TO ENJOY IS AN INCREDIBLE IDEA AND EVERYONE SHOULD BE DOING IT . I DO WANT TO SAY THAT THE COMMUNITY IN WHICH WE THE DISTRICT SERVES HAVE REALLY TAKEN A REAL GOOD VIEW OF THE OF THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS THAT THESE DIFFERENT AND SPACE HAVE BEEN TRANSFORMED INTO. >> I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO TO GO AND VISIT SOME OF THESE AND YOU WOULD NOT BELIEVE HOW MUCH OF AN IMPACT IT MAKES IN THE COMMUNITY. I HAVE FOUR GRANDCHILDREN AND YOU KNOW, LIVING IN AN AREA WHERE THERE'S DEVELOPMENT GOING ON ALL THE TIME. >> THERE ISN'T VERY MANY OPEN GREEN SPACES FOR THE KIDS TO TO USE. SO I WANT TO SAY THAT YOUR SUPPORT WILL MEAN A LOT TO THE TO OUR COMMUNITY AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS. WELCOME TO OUR NEXT SPEAKER. >> YES, I'M ONE OF THE OLDER ONES SHE REPRESENTED WHEN THEY TAKE CARE OF THE LITTLE ONES AND THE BIG ONES AND EVERYBODY I'M GOING TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT NORTHWEST POTRERO IN 19 54, CALTRANS DIVIDED NORTHWEST POTRERO INTO BYE BYE INTO TWO BY STATE HIGHWAY ONE AND ONE. >> SINCE THEN THE NEIGHBORS HAVE HAD TO DEAL WITH AND WORKED TO IMPROVE THE GREEN SPACES THAT PREVIOUSLY HELD HOMES. >> MAY I ASK YOU TO SPEAK MORE DIRECTLY INTO THAT MICROPHONE? >> OKAY. THANK YOU. I LIKE THAT. OKAY. BENCHES GARDEN PLOT AND PLAZA FALL FALLEN BRIDGE PARK VERMONT GATEWAY IN ECHO ECHO PATCH AND THE THE PETRO GATEWAY ARE OPEN SPACES ON CALTRANS PROPERTY THAT WERE EITHER CREATED BY OR UPGRADED BY THE G B D SINCE 2015 THAT'S THOSE ARE SOME THINGS YOU SEE WE CONTINUE WE NEED TO CONTINUE MAINTENANCE AND TO CONTINUE TO IMPROVE THESE OPEN SPACES PARTICULARLY AROUND THE FREEWAY. THESE AREAS ARE USED BY THE COMMUNITY FOR PODUNK BLOCK PARTIES, EGGPLANTS AND ENJOYING THE BEAUTY OF THE OUTDOORS. >> IN ADDITION THE GPD TAKES CARE OF ADDING TREES TO SIDEWALK GARDENS. THE GPD IS AN ELECTED BOARD OF DIRECTORS. DECISIONS ARE MADE BY VOTING AT OPEN MEETINGS BRING IN BRINGING DRAMATIC DEMOCRATIC PROCESSES INTO THE NEIGHBORHOOD PROVIDES A VALUABLE SOCIAL CONTROL AND SALARY LOCAL FUNDING LOCAL GOVERNANCE ADVOCACY AND VOLUNTEERISM WELL CREATE A BEAUTIFUL GREEN OPEN SPACES IN NORTH POTRERO AND THAT'S WHAT WE'D LIKE YOU TO SUPPORT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS AND WELCOME TO OUR NEXT SPEAKER . >> GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MANAGEMENT AND SUPERVISORS. MY NAME IS REBECCA GROVES AND I'M A PROPERTY OWNER IN DOGPATCH AND A VOLUNTEER ELECTED BOARD MEMBER OF THE GREEN BENEFIT DISTRICT. I'M HERE TODAY TO EXPRESS MY ENTHUSIASTIC SUPPORT FOR RENEWING THE GBD FOR ANOTHER 15 YEAR TERM. >> I BECAME AN OWNER A HOMEOWNER IN DOGPATCH FOUR YEARS AGO AFTER HAVING RENTED FOR MANY YEARS IN THE MISSION WHEN MY DAUGHTER STARTED PRESCHOOL IN 2020. WE BIKED HER TO SCHOOL IN DOGPATCH AND FOUND AN INCREDIBLY WARM AND VIBRANT FAMILY NEIGHBORHOOD SCENE AT THE WOODS YARD PARK ON 22ND STREET. A PARK CREATED AND CARED FOR BY THE GBD. >> WE WERE LUCKY ENOUGH TO SPEND THE PANDEMIC SOCIALIZING DAILY OUTSIDE WITH OTHER FAMILIES BECAUSE THE GBD HAD CREATED AND CONTINUED TO MAINTAIN THIS LEAFY GREEN PARK AND PLAYGROUNDS WHERE THE KIDS AND PARENTS ALL WANTED TO GATHER TOGETHER. >> NOW I AM FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO OWN A HOME ON MINNESOTA STREET JUST UP THE STREET FROM WOODS YARD PARK. THE SIDEWALK ON OUR STREET IS PLANTED WITH CALIFORNIA NATIVES COURTESY OF THE GBD. >> I'M SO THANKFUL THAT WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DIRECTLY SUPPORT THE SERVICES OF THE GBD TO ENSURE THAT OUR NEIGHBORHOOD GREEN SPACES ARE WELL-DESIGNED, PROPERLY MAINTAINED AND ACTIVATED WITH COMMUNITY EVENTS THAT OUR WHOLE FAMILY ENJOYS. I KNOW THAT OUR ASSESSMENT DOLLARS IMPROVE NOT ONLY OUR DAILY QUALITY OF LIFE OUTDOORS IN OUR COMMUNITY AND THE SUCCESS OF OUR LOCAL BUSINESSES BUT ALSO THE OPPORTUNITIES AND THRIVING OF THE DISTRICT AS A WHOLE. THANK YOU FOR SUPPORTING THE RENEWAL THE GBD. I HOPE THAT ITS SUCCESS CAN SERVE AS A MODEL FOR OTHER NEIGHBORHOODS IN SAN FRANCISCO. >> THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS. >> NEXT SPEAKER ON THE GREEN BENEFIT DISTRICT RESIDENT GENTLEMAN SUPERVISORS I'M J.R. HEPLER, PRESIDENT OF THE PATROL BOOSTERS NEIGHBORHOOD ASSOCIATION. >> I WANT TO UNDERLINE A LITTLE BIT FURTHER THE QUESTION OF WHY AGREED TO BEGIN WITH. >> WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THE FREEWAYS AND THE CALTRANS RIGHTS OF WAY THAT SURROUND THEM. WE'RE ALSO A NEIGHBORHOOD. THIS IS ENDEMIC TO THE SOUTHEAST SECTOR OF THE CITY THAT'S POST-INDUSTRIAL AND HAS POST-INDUSTRIAL INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S HISTORICALLY BEEN UNDER INVESTIGATION, UNDER INVESTED IN. WE HAVE CALTRAIN AND THE CALTRAIN RATES AWAY AND WE HAVE A PLETHORA OF UNACCEPTED STREETS, PAPER STREETS AND UNACCEPTED CITY RIGHTS AWAY. PUT TOGETHER THIS IS A RECIPE FOR BLIGHT IN ABOUT A DECADE AGO THINGS WERE NOT LOOKING VERY GOOD. HENCE A GREEN BENEFIT DISTRICT. AND IN THE INTERVENING TEN YEARS THAT GREEN BENEFIT DISTRICT HAS WORKED WITH TRANSPARENCY AND FLEXIBILITY. I'VE LIVED IN THE BENEFIT DISTRICT. I'VE NEVER BEEN ON THE BOARD. I CURRENTLY DON'T LIVE IN THE BENEFIT DISTRICT BUT I DO KNOW THAT IT HAS WORKED WELL WITH OTHER NEIGHBORHOOD GROUPS THAT IT'S BEEN WILLING TO TAKE ON NEW CHALLENGES AND NEW PROJECTS IN COLLABORATION WITH THE BROADER COMMUNITY. >> AND SO NOW WE HAVE THESE IMPROVEMENTS THOSE IMPROVEMENTS NEED MAINTENANCE. >> THERE'S STILL MORE WORK TO BE DONE BECAUSE THOSE FREEWAYS, THOSE UNACCEPTED STREETS THEY HAVEN'T GONE AWAY AND WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO CHIP AWAY AT THOSE MARGINAL USES AND MAKE THEM AMENITIES FOR THE COMMUNITY. SO I'M ASKING YOU TO PLEASE REVIEW THE GREEN BENEFIT DISTRICT FOR ANOTHER 15 YEARS SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE THE GOOD WORK THAT THE BENEFIT DISTRICT HAS DONE. >> THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS. ALL RIGHT. THIS IS THE LAST CALL FOR ANY SPEAKERS ON THE GREEN BENEFIT DISTRICT. >> ALL RIGHT. SEEING NONE, MR. PRESIDENT. ALL RIGHT. PUBLIC COMMENT IS NOW CLOSED AND THE HEARING HAS BEEN HELD AND IS NOW FILED. THE BALLOTS WILL BE TABULATED AND WE WILL RETURN TO ITEM NUMBER 48 AFTER THE DEPARTMENT OF ELECTIONS REPORTS THE RESULTS. MEMBERS MAY PROVIDE ADDITIONAL COMMENTS AT THAT TIME BUT BEFORE WE CONSIDER THE RESOLUTION TO ESTABLISH MADAM CLERK, LET'S GO BACK TO ITEM 40 TWO. >> ADAM, 42, WAS REFERRED WITHOUT RECOMMENDATION FROM THE LAND USE AND TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE. >> IT'S A RESOLUTION TO OPPOSE CALIFORNIA STATE SENATE BILL NUMBER 79 HOUSING DEVELOPMENT TRANSIT ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT INTRODUCED BY SENATOR SCOTT WIENER UNLESS AMENDED TO GIVE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ADEQUATE ABILITY TO FORMULATE LOCAL PLANS THROUGH ITS LOCAL LEGISLATIVE PROCESS. >> SUPERVISOR. >> THANK YOU. PRESENT AMENDMENT COLLEAGUES. I DO ACTUALLY WANT TO FIRST THANK THE LAND USE COMMITTEE FOR ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW, SENDING THIS TO FULL BOARD SO THAT WE CAN HAVE THIS DISCUSSION HERE TODAY. SO FOR THAT I AM GRATEFUL TO HAVE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO ALLOW THIS TO BE VOTED ON. >> I, I WANT TO SAY THAT THIS IS I WANT TO START WITH HOW THAT THIS IS PERSONAL FOR ME AND THEN I'LL GO INTO A LITTLE BIT OF THE POLICY DISCUSSION HERE AROUND SB 79. AGAIN, THIS IS NOT TO OPPOSE 79 WHATEVER. HOWEVER ULTIMATELY IS BUT IT'S REALLY TO OPPOSE IT AS IT CURRENTLY WRITTEN. >> AND ONE FLASHING POINT THAT I WANT TO RAISE FOR YOU IS REALLY THE DEMOLITION OF RENT CONTROL UNITS. >> I CAME TO SAN FRANCISCO'S CHINATOWN WHEN I WAS 13 YEARS OLD, GREW UP IN IN THAT SPACE BECAUSE IT WAS A RENT CONTROL UNIT. AND TODAY HERE I AM YOU KNOW, I WENT TO PUBLIC SCHOOL AND I BE ABLE TO THRIVE AND TAKE ROOTS AND RAISE MY OWN FAMILY IN SAN FRANCISCO. I WOULD CONTRIBUTE TO THAT TO THE FACT THAT I HAD A STABLE HOME IN CHINATOWN AND BECAUSE A HOME THAT MY MOTHER A SINGLE MOM RAISING TWO TEENAGE KIDS COULD AFFORD. >> AND THEN YOU KNOW, FAST FORWARD TO 2021 WHEN MY MOTHER HAD CANCER AND THAT YOU KNOW, WE SHE WAS STAYING IN UCSF PARNASSUS CAMPUS. WE WERE HER LAST DAYS AND WE HAD TO IDENTIFY IN A HOSPICE BUT WE COULDN'T FIND A SPACE WHERE EITHER WE COULD AFFORD OR THAT BE ABLE TO TIMELY MOVE HER IN THERE. WHAT HAPPENED IN HER LAST DAYS WAS WE WERE ABLE TO RETURN IN THE VERY SAME APARTMENT THAT SHE RAISED ME RENT CONTROL UNITS THAT WE COULD AFFORD FOR HER TO STAY THERE FOR HER LAST DAYS BEFORE SHE PASSED THROUGH PATHS IN A SPACE WHERE SHE RAISED ME AND MY BROTHER. SHE LIVED AND WORKED THERE. SHE WORKED ON POWELL STREET FOR ON STARVING SENIORS AND OF COURSE CHINESE HOSPITAL BEFORE THAT SHE WAS ABLE TO DEDICATE HER LIFE AND HER COMMUNITY BUILDING AND EVEN IN HER LAST DAYS IN THE SPACE SHE LOVED AND CARE FOR ALL THIS I PERSONALLY CONTRIBUTED TO A RENT CONTROL UNIT, A RENT CONTROL UNIT FOR A FAMILY LIKE MINE THE SINGLE FAMILY IMMIGRANTS FIRST GENERATION IMMIGRANT UNITS, FAMILY CAN ACTUALLY STAY AND THRIVE AND GROW TODAY. AND SO FOR SB 79 BEING THROUGH ALL THE COMMITTEE AND THANKS TO CHAIR MAL GAR LIKE TRYING TO REALLY FIGURE OUT SOME CONSENSUS AND URGING AMENDMENTS THROUGH COMMITTEE BOTH AT THE HOUSING COMMITTEE THAT YOU KNOW, ASSEMBLY MEMBER MATT HANEY CHAIRED WAS REPRESENTING US AND THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT COMMITTEE AND THE STATE ASSEMBLY AGAIN YET THERE WAS NO CONSENSUS THAT COULD ACTUALLY TO EITHER CARVE OUT SAN FRANCISCO OR TO REALLY FIGURE OUT A WAY, YOU KNOW, SO THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT OUR LOCAL CONTROL FOR DEMOLITION PROTECTION. WHAT IT HAS LEFT US IS THAT THE ALLOWANCE FOR A STATE Y DEMOLITION OF ANY STRUCTURE WOULD TO RENT CONTROL UNITS OR LESS. THAT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR SAN FRANCISCO. I CAN UNDERSTAND MAYBE OTHER JURISDICTIONS HAVE DIFFERENT SITUATION AND I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT YOU KNOW THAT IT'S IS DIFFERENT IN ATTRACTING DIFFERENT IN OTHER COUNTIES THAT ARE IS WEALTHIER BUT THAT'S NOT THE CASE FOR SAN FRANCISCO AND AS A POLICY MAKER IN SAN FRANCISCO I HAVE TO FIGHT FOR SAN FRANCISCO AND BUT IT'S I'M NOT JUST FIGHTING FOR SAN FRANCISCO. I'M FIGHTING FOR EVERY INDIVIDUAL THAT LIVE IN THAT RENT CONTROL UNIT, BE A SENIOR AND BE AN IMMIGRANT FAMILY OR MAYBE NOT EVEN A REAL AMERICAN FAMILY BUT MAYBE AN ARTISAN A MUSICIAN THAT THEY ARE ABLE TO LIVE IN SAN FRANCISCO AND THRIVE TODAY IS BECAUSE THERE IS A RENT CONTROL UNITS FOR THEM. >> SO WITH THAT COLLEAGUES I HOPE TO HAVE YOUR SUPPORT. >> I DO BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A MOMENT THAT YOU KNOW, SEEING OUR FUTURE WHERE WE'RE HEADING THIS IS A QUESTION AGAIN AND I APPRECIATE ALL MY COLLEAGUES AND BECAUSE WE ALL REPRESENT SUCH A DIVERSE CITY AND DIFFERENT DISTRICT BUT THIS IS A MOMENT IS WHO ARE WE BUILDING FOR WHAT IS WHO'S GOING TO GET TO STAY IN OUR CITY AND THRIVE? >> AND FOR ME SINCE 1990 HERE IN SAN FRANCISCO AS A 13 YEAR OLD AND TO TODAY AS A POLICYMAKER, I HOPE THAT YOU KNOW THAT A FAMILY LIKE MINE CAN STILL BE HERE AND THRIVE 30 YEARS FROM NOW, 40 YEARS FROM NOW, 50 YEARS FROM NOW. >> AND AND SO I DO HOPE TO HAVE YOUR SUPPORT. >> AND ONE THING I ALSO WANT TO HIGHLIGHT FOR YOU IS THAT WITH SB 79 AS IT CURRENTLY STANDS, THERE IS NO MECHANISM SSM THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO STATE MECHANISM THAT ALLOW US TO ACTUALLY HAVE IMPLEMENT IT ON A LOCAL LEVEL TO REALLY HAVE A TENANTS AND SMALL BUSINESS PROTECTION AND THERE'S NO SUPPORT FROM THE STATE LEVEL BUT AGAIN LEGISLATIVE TOOLS OR FUNDING SOURCES FOR US TO DO SO AND FOR THAT I JUST DON'T THINK THAT I CAN SUPPORT SB 79 AS IT CURRENTLY IS AND THAT I HOPE TO HAVE YOUR SUPPORT THAT WE WILL OPPOSE 79 UNLESS AMENDED. >> THANK YOU CHAIR MELGAR THANK YOU SO MUCH. >> PRESIDENT RANDLEMAN SO THANK YOU SUPERVISOR TRAN FOR THE ROBUST DISCUSSION AT THE LADIES COMMITTEE WHERE WE HOSTED YOU FOR THIS ITEM. THIS ITEM CAME OUT OF THE COMMITTEE WITHOUT RECOMMENDATION SO THAT WE COULD HAVE THIS CONVERSATION HERE AND I AGREE WITH SUPERVISOR CHAN ABOUT THE PROTECTION OF RENT CONTROLLED UNITS IN BUILDINGS UP TO UNITS OR LESS. AND I ALSO THINK THIS IS A QUESTION OF STRATEGY. I AM NOT READY TO SUPPORT A LEGISLATION OPPOSING SB 79 TODAY AS WE STILL HAVE SIX MORE WEEKS WHERE THIS LEGISLATION CAN BE AMENDED. IN THE PAST MONTH AND A HALF I HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH BOTH ASSEMBLY MEMBER HANY AND SENATOR WIENER ON AMENDMENTS TO SB 79 AND EVEN THOUGH WE'RE NOT QUITE THERE YET ON TWO ISSUES ON THE ISSUE OF RENT CONTROL IN BUILDINGS OF TWO UNITS OR LESS. AND ALSO ON THE CLEAR LANGUAGE ON BETTER CLEAR LANGUAGE WHICH IS NOT CURRENTLY SB 79 WHEN IT COMES TO PRIORITY EQUITY GEOGRAPHIES. SO AS OF RIGHT NOW WE ACTUALLY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET QUITE A BIT IN BOTH THE HOUSING COMMITTEE, THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT COMMITTEE AND THE TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE IN SB 79 AGAIN WORKING WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER HANY IN WIENER AND WITH A COALITION OF FOLKS IN L.A. AND IN BERKELEY. SO I THINK THIS IS THE WAY THE PROCESS IS SUPPOSED TO WORK SO WE'RE NOT QUITE THERE YET BUT I'M NOT READY TO OPPOSE IT TO DAY AS WE ARE STILL MAKING PROGRESS. THAT BEING SAID, I THINK THAT IT IS SOMETHING THAT I INVITE ALL OF YOU WHO HAVE INTEREST IN LAND USE TO LOOK AT AND TO WEIGH IN. THEY THESE FOLKS IN SACRAMENTO REPRESENT US OVERALL. THIS IS A LEGISLATION THAT WILL COVER ALL OF CALIFORNIA. WHAT IT IS MEANT TO DO IS TO GUIDE DEVELOPMENT AROUND TRANSIT SITES, HIGH TRANSIT SITES, RAIL AND YOU KNOW, BRT SITES. AND SO IT IS SOMETHING THAT I THINK WE ALL AGREE SHOULD HAPPEN IN CALIFORNIA. MILLBRAE, BRISBANE, FRESNO ALL OF THESE CITIES AROUND CALIFORNIA THAT NEED TO DEVELOP HOUSING SHOULD DO SO AROUND PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION AND NOT AROUND FREEWAYS AND NOT AROUND THE WAYS THAT WE HAVE IN THE PAST LED OUR DEVELOPMENT TO BE CAR CENTRIC. IT IS SUPPORTING OUR CLIMATE CHANGE GOALS AND ALSO SUPPORTING RIDERSHIP IN OUR PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS WHICH WE ALL I THINK AGREE SHOULD HAPPEN NOW HOW IT ALL INTERSPERSES WITH OUR HOUSING ELEMENT IS THE QUESTION. AND WE'RE STILL WORKING OUT THE LANGUAGE AND THE DETAILS. >> AND WHILE I SUPPORT THE TWO FOUNDING TIONAL ELEMENTS OF OUR HOUSING ELEMENT WHICH ARE THE PRESERVATION OF RENT CONTROLLED HOUSING AND THE PRESERVATION OF PRIORITY EQUITY GEOGRAPHIES AND THE LANGUAGE IN SB 79 COULD BE CLEAR AROUND BOTH. I AM NOT READY TO SAY TODAY THAT I OPPOSE IT UNLESS AMENDED. THANK YOU. >> SUPERVISOR MAHMOOD. >> COLLEAGUES, I WISH TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF SENATOR WEINER'S AND SPEAK 79 AND I AS SUPERVISOR MELGAR MENTIONED I DO RESPECT THE RESOLUTION AND MY COLLEAGUES WHO SUPPORT THIS RESOLUTION WHICH IS WHY WE WERE HAPPY TO PASS IT OUT OF COMMITTEE. SO EVERYONE AT THE FULL BOARD CAN HAVE A DISCUSSION AND RESPECT THAT WE MAY NOT ALWAYS AGREE BUT I JUST WANTED TO CENTER THE CONVERSATION AROUND WHAT DOES SB 79 DO AND A SUPERVISOR MELGAR MENTIONED IT IS THE POSITIVE DIRECTION TO ALLOW FOR MORE HOMES TO BE BUILT IN THE PARTS OF THE STATE WHERE WE NEED TO BE BUILDING WHICH IS NEAR MAJOR TRANSIT STATIONS. >> THE LEGISLATION SPECIFICALLY ALLOWS FOR BUILDINGS UP TO 75FT TALL NEAR BARTON CALTRAIN STATIONS AND ALLOWS FOR TRANSIT AGENCIES TO BE MORE EASILY DEVELOP THEIR OWN LAND. >> THIS WILL HELP SUPPORT THE TRANSIT SYSTEMS THAT SAN FRANCISCO RELIES ON IN THIS DIFFICULT FISCAL ENVIRONMENT BY PROVIDING A LONG TERM SOURCE OF RELIABLE REVENUE. >> IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE HOW SB 79 WAS WRITTEN AND WHAT IT DOES NOT DO. DUE TO AMENDMENTS IN THE PROCESS THAT BOTH ASSEMBLYMEMBER MAHANEY AND SENATOR WIENER WORKED ON TOGETHER, IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE ARE ADDITIONAL RESTRICTIONS ON DEMOLITION IN THIS LEGISLATION WHICH ARE SOME OF THE STRONGEST IN STATE LAW AND ALSO DOESN'T OVERRIDE LOCAL TENANT PROTECTIONS OR LOCAL AFFORDABILITY REQUIREMENTS MEANING NEW HOMES WILL BE FOR CURRENT AND FUTURE SAN FRANCISCANS AT ALL INCOME LEVELS AND NOT JUST AT THE HIGH END. >> THE REVENUE GENERATED BY INCLUSIONARY HOUSING FEES WILL HELP INVIGORATE OUR AFFORDABLE HOUSING PIPELINE AS WELL. >> LASTLY, THE OPTION IN THE LEGISLATION FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO CREATE A LOCAL ALTERNATIVE PLAN WILL ALLOW THE PLANNING DEPARTMENT AN OPPORTUNITY TO ENSURE THE INCREASED IN ZONE CAPACITY FITS INTO THE CITY'S LAND USE CONTEXT AND IS IN SYNC WITH OUR ONGOING HOUSING ELEMENT REZONING. SO AGAIN FIRMLY I DO BELIEVE THAT GROWTH GROWTH NEAR TRANSIT IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF OUR VISION FOR AN EQUITABLE AND ENVIRONMENTALLY SUSTAINABLE URBAN SAN FRANCISCO. AND FOR THAT REASON I AM STILL SUPPORTING SB 79 AND WILL BE VOTING NO ON THIS RESOLUTION. >> SURPRISE DISORDER. YES. COLLEAGUES, THANK YOU FOR THIS DISCUSSION. I WILL ALSO BE SUPPORTING SB 79 AND REJECTING THIS RESOLUTION. >> YOU KNOW IN THESE CHAMBERS WE OFTEN SPEAK ABOUT WANTING TO CREATE MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING, FINDING SOLUTIONS TO TRANSIT FUNDING AND DOING OUR PART TO FIGHT CLIMATE CHANGE. SO ALONG COMES A BILL THAT ADDRESSES ALL THREE OF THESE CRITICAL PRIORITIES. AND YET HERE WE ARE CONSIDERING OPPOSING IT. IF WE DECIDE TO OPPOSE THIS LEGISLATION AS A CITY I BELIEVE WE STAND CONTRARY TO ALL OF OUR STATED ASPIRATIONS. I BELIEVE THAT TRANSIT ORIENTED VELOPMENT IS ONE OF THE BEST TOOLS WE HAVE TO MEET THE HOUSING TRANSIT AND CLIMATE NEEDS OF OUR CITY. BECAUSE WHEN PEOPLE LIVE NEAR WHERE THEY WORK IT HELPS STRENGTHEN OUR COMMUNITIES, BOOST TRANSIT RIDERSHIP AND PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT. OUR TRANSIT SYSTEMS ARE INDEED IN AN EXTREME FUNDING CRISIS THAT WE ARE ALL WELL AWARE OF. AND THIS LEGISLATION WOULD GIVE TRANSIT AGENCIES GREATER ABILITY TO BUILD ON THE LAND THAT THEY OWN WHICH WOULD PROVIDE DESPERATELY NEEDED REVENUE STREAMS FOR OUR SYSTEMS WHILE PRODUCING HOUSING FOR OUR COMMUNITIES ON UNDERUTILIZED LAND. FOR THE PAST 15 YEARS I HAVE LIVED IN A RENT CONTROLLED HOUSING IN SAN FRANCISCO AND I'M CURRENTLY RAISING MY FAMILY IN RENT CONTROLLED APARTMENT THAT WE LOVE. SO I UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS AND UNCERTAINTY THAT MANY OF US HAVE ABOUT NEW DEVELOPMENT AND HOW IT MIGHT IMPACT OUR HOMES AND NEIGHBORHOODS. I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT WE ARE GOING THROUGH A COMPLEX SIGNIFICANT REZONING PROCESS THAT WILL PROVIDE OUR NEIGHBORHOODS WITH CAPACITY TO ADD MORE HOUSING IN THE COMING YEARS. BUT LET'S BE CLEAR FIGHTING NEW HOUSING DOES NOT MAKE OUR CITY MORE AFFORDABLE. FINDING NEW HOUSING ONLY HELPS ONE GROUP LANDLORDS BECAUSE NO ONE WINS IN A HOUSING SHORTAGE MORE THAN THEY DO. THE RESOLUTION BEFORE US ASKS TO OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED. SB 79 HAS HAD SIGNIFICANT AMENDMENTS SINCE THIS RESOLUTION WAS FIRST INTRODUCED. THESE AMENDMENTS ADDRESS MANY CONCERNS AROUND AFFORDABILITY REQUIREMENTS AND HOW THIS LAW WOULD INTERACT WITH OUR LOCAL ZONING PROCESS. >> TO BE VERY CLEAR, THE LEGISLATION CONTAINS AFFORDABILITY AND DEMOLITION PROTECTIONS. IT HAS BEEN AMENDED TO INCLUDE A HIGHER AFFORDABILITY REQUIREMENT THAN CURRENTLY EXISTS IN THE STATE DENSITY BONUS LAW. I FIRMLY BELIEVE WE CAN BUILD NEW HOUSING IN RESOURCE AND TRANSIT RICH NEIGHBORHOODS WHILE PROTECTING TENANTS IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS WE LOVE. SB 79, ESPECIALLY THROUGH THESE RECENT AMENDMENTS BALANCES ALL OF THESE NEEDS AND SO FOR THESE REASONS I WILL BE VOTING AGAINST THE RESOLUTION WHICH I BELIEVE TO BE CONTRARY TO OUR HOUSING, TRANSIT AND CLIMATE GOALS. >> THANK YOU. SUPERVISOR JIM SUPERVISOR CHEN THANK YOU COLLEAGUES. >> I AM A CO-SPONSOR SO I WANT TO ECHO THAT. I ALSO BELIEVE THAT POLICY THAT'S INCENTIVIZE TRANSIT ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT CAN BE BENEFICIAL AS THEY REDUCE COMMUTES, LOWER CARBON EMISSIONS AND REDUCE OUR RELIANCE ON CARS. >> HOWEVER, I ALSO BELIEVE THAT OUR POLICIES MUST BE TAILOR. WE CAN INCENTIVIZE DEVELOPMENT IN AREAS THAT CAN ABSORB IT WITHOUT CAUSING HARMS SUCH AS AREA WHAT ROBUST EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE AND LESS DISPLACEMENT RISK FOR NEIGHBOR WHO ARE FACING DISPLACEMENT. WE MUST PRIORITIZE ANTI DISPLACEMENT STRATEGY, ROBUST TENANT PROTECTION AND PROTECTION FOR OUR STOCK OF RENT CONTROL HOUSING AND SIGNIFICANTLY INVESTING IN TRULY AFFORDABLE HOUSING. SO OTHERWISE SAN FRANCISCO WOULD NOT BECOME CONTINUE TO BE AFFORDABLE FOR WORKING FAMILY WHICH MY DISTRICT IS HEAVILY WORKING FAMILY WHO ARE CONTINUE TO HOPING TO RAISE THEIR FAMILY IN SAN FRANCISCO AND ALSO RETIRE IN AND STATE WITH DIGNITY AND SAFETY IN SAN FRANCISCO. SO I YOU KNOW I OPPOSE ANY OF DEPOSIT THAT WOULD LIKELY TO PUSH OUT FAMILY AND BUSINESS THAT HAVE BUILT THE FABRIC OF THIS COMMUNITY FOR GENERATIONS. THANK YOU. >> SUPERVISOR CHAN THANK YOU. AND AGAIN, YOU KNOW, COLLEAGUES, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR COMMENT TODAY. I WANT TO ALSO SAY THIS I THINK EVEN OUR LAND USE WHEN IT WAS AT LAND USE COMMITTEE I WELCOME ANY FEEDBACK AND AMENDMENT AND THE GOAL IS TO SAY THAT WHAT IS IT THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO WHAT IS IT THAT IF WE HAVE NO CONSENSUS ABOUT WHAT WE LIKE TO SEE IN SB 979 TO BE AMENDED, WHAT ARE THE AMENDMENTS THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE SO THAT WE CAN BE FULLY ON BOARD WITH 79? SO I JUST FIRST WANTED TO SAY THAT I WELCOME THAT AMENDMENT TO SAY WHAT CAN 79 TO DO BETTER AND I WILL SUPPORT IT. I THINK THAT WHAT IT'S REALLY BEFORE US TODAY IS IT'S NOT JUST SB 79 IS ALSO WHAT WE'RE GOING TO SEE IN THE MAYOR'S PROPOSAL. ONE IS UP ZONING THE ENTIRE CITY AND IT'S A LAYERS OF LAYERS OF BOTH STATE LEGISLATION AND HOUSING ELEMENTS THE MANDATE LAYERING A 79 LAYERING WHAT IS UPCOMING ON A LOCAL UP ZONING PLAN THAT IS WHERE I'M HEADING TO THINK ABOUT IT IN A BIG PICTURE. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN ACTUALLY FOR THE SMALL BUSINESS AND THE TENANTS AND AGING HOMEOWNERS IN SAN FRANCISCO AND WHAT DOES IT DO ACTUALLY TO THEM TO US AND AND I THINK THAT TODAY IF WE CEDED THE SPACE TO SAY GO AHEAD ALLOWING THE DEMOLITION OF EVEN JUST ONE RENT CONTROL UNITS IN SAN FRANCISCO WITHOUT ANY TYPE OF COMMITMENT TO ALSO TENANT PROTECTION AND SMALL BUSINESS IT BECOMES THE FLOOR 79 WILL BECOME THE FLOOR FOR UP ZONING IT WILL NOT IT'S NOT A CEILING IT'S IT BECOMES A FLOOR FOR UP ZONING FOR SAN FRANCISCO FOR THE UPCOMING UP ZONING PLAN DISCUSSION THAT WE WILL HAVE TO FACE THIS FALL. SO I DON'T THINK THAT THE FLOOR I DO NOT FIND ACCEPTABLE AS A FLOOR. I AM OF COURSE URGING FOR YOUR SUPPORT BUT I KNOW WHERE WE'RE HEADING TODAY AND FOR THIS REASON I DO ACTUALLY AGAIN WANT TO THANK THE LAND USE COMMITTEE FOR ALLOWING THIS VOTE TO TAKE PLACE TODAY. >> THANK YOU.

WE NEED TO DO WITH OUR STATE PARTNERS AND THAT MEANS HAVING DENSE HOUSING NEAR TRANSIT WE CANNOT RELY ON AFFORDABILITY ON OUR OWN NO MATTER HOW MUCH HOUSING WE BUILD.

THANK YOU MADAM CLERK COLLEAGUES, I HAVE A RESOLUTION AND AN IN MEMORIAM TODAY. FIRST I'M INTRODUCING A RESOLUTION TO INITIATE THE LANDMARKING PROCESS FOR THE MINT MALL AN INVALUABLE NEIGHBORHOOD ASSET FOR THE SELMA AND FILIPINO COMMUNITIES BUILT IN 1969 OR 1916 AS A RESIDENTIAL HOTEL. THE MINT MALL TRANSFERRED TO FULFILL FILIPINO OWNERSHIP IN THE 1980S. SINCE THEN A LARGE POPULATION OF FILIPINO RESIDENTS HAS RESIDED IN THE APARTMENTS IN THE UPPER RESIDENTIAL FLOORS OF THE BUILDING KNOWN AS MINT HALL AND SUPPORTED BY A HOST OF FILIPINO SMALL BUSINESSES AND NONPROFITS BELOW IN THE MINT MALL NOTABLE FILIPINO BUSINESSES AND NONPROFITS PAST AND PRESENT INCLUDED ARE ARCHIPELAGO BOOKS TEATRO IN TAINAN AND NEW FILIPINOS RESTAURANT NOW CALLED J TEA RESTAURANT WHICH AS I HAVE SAID PREVIOUSLY IN THIS CHAMBER'S PUTS MY IRISH ANCESTORS TO SHAME FOR THE WORLD'S BEST BEEF STEW. I WOULD BE REMISS NOT ALSO TO MENTION EDDIE'S BARBER AND BEAUTY SHOP WHERE I OFTEN GET MY HAIRCUT. MANY OF THESE BUSINESSES AND NONPROFITS ARE AMONG THOSE THAT SUCCESSFULLY FOUGHT AMONG AGAINST THEIR EVICTION FROM THE MINT MALL WITH THE HELP OF COMMUNITY ORGANIZERS UNDER THE MINT MALL ORGANIZING COMMITTEE. THE MINT MALL IS MORE THAN JUST THE BUSINESSES AND RESIDENCES THAT MAKE UP THE BUILDING. IT IS THE BEATING HEART AND SENATE CENTER OF GRAVITY OF SAN FRANCISCO'S FILIPINO COMMUNITY AND IT'S OFTEN THE FIRST STOP FOR NEW IMMIGRANTS FROM THE PHILIPPINES. AT JT RESTAURANT YOU CAN NOT ONLY GET A DELICIOUS HOME COOKED MEAL THERE, YOU CAN ALSO GET THE SUPPORT AND GUIDANCE FROM TITA TESS, A DE FACTO SOCIAL WORKER AND COMMUNITY MATRIARCH WHO LENDS A LOVING HAND TO ANYONE WHO NEEDS IT AND AS A FELLOW PARISHIONER FROM ST PATRICK'S. TESS HAS ALSO BEEN A KNOWLEDGEABLE SPIRITUAL ADVISOR TO ME WHENEVER I NEED TO KNOW WHICH ST TO LIGHT A CANDLE TO WHICH IS FOR WHICH DESIRED OUTCOME. THE SENIOR CENTER ACROSS THE HALL OFFERS COMMUNITY HEALTH SERVICES AND A WELCOMING PLACE FOR OUR COMMUNITY'S ELDERS. IT'S ALSO A HOST FOR SIGNIFICANT CULTURAL EVENTS LIKE THE ANNUAL PASCAL'S SOMA AND THE FIRST PARALLEL MAKING WORKSHOPS FOR THE PAROLE LANTERN FESTIVAL. THIS LANDMARKING EFFORT FURTHERS THE GOALS OF THE SOMA PILIPINAS CULTURAL HISTORY, HOUSING AND ECONOMIC SUSTAINABILITY STRATEGY REPORT OR CHESS REPORT. THIS REPORT WAS ADOPTED BY THE CITY IN 2022 AND ONE OF THE KEY STRATEGIES IS TWO LANDMARK BUILDINGS IN SOMA THAT HAVE CULTURAL AND HISTORIC SIGNIFICANCE TO THE FILIPINO COMMUNITY. TO BUILD ON THIS AND TO EXPAND EFFORTS TO IMPLEMENT THE CHESS REPORT SAMA PILIPINAS AND SOM KEN WORKED WITH THE PLANNING DEPARTMENT TO CREATE THE CHESS AFFORDABLE HOUSING IMPLEMENTATION PLAN WHICH IDENTIFIED THE MALL AS A BUILDING TO BE EXPLORED FOR HISTORIC LANDMARKING. IN LINE WITH SOM KEN AND SOMA PILIPINAS PUSH FOR GREATER FILIPINO LANGUAGE ACCESS IN THE CITY THIS LANDMARK REPORT WILL ALSO BE THE FIRST TO BE WRITTEN BILINGUALLY IN ENGLISH AND FILIPINO. THERE ARE MANY INDIVIDUALS WHO PLAYED A ROLE IN THIS THOROUGH RESEARCH AND COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT THAT I WOULD LIKE TO THANK MOSES KHAIRAT FROM THE PLANNING DEPARTMENT FROM SOM KEN ANGELICA CARBONDALE, ZACHARY FREE ALL AND WILFRED GULLIBLE GALELLA FROM SOMA PILIPINAS RAQUEL VERDUN DIAZ AND DAVID WU AND FROM THE MANY COMMUNITY MEMBERS WHO WERE INTERVIEWED GENIE THE ABOUT LOWNESS TEST DIAZ ALLEN MANALO M.S. CANLAS ESTHER AND NYX CARRIE PABLO GRAVEDIGGER AND LORENZO LA STANA. I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE PLANNING DEPARTMENT AND THE COMMUNITY TO ADVANCE THIS LANDMARKING PROCESS. SECOND AND FINALLY I WOULD LIKE TO ASK THAT WE ADJOURN TODAY'S MEETING TO HONOR THE MEMORY OF DAN DILLON, A BELOVED SAN FRANCISCAN DEDICATED CIVIC LEADER AND A LONGTIME PRESENCE IN OUR CITY'S PUBLIC AFFAIRS COMMUNITY WHO PASSED AWAY EARLIER THIS MONTH. DAN BROUGHT HIS SOUTHERN CHARM TO SAN FRANCISCO IN THE MID 1990S AND OVER THE LAST THREE DECADES BECAME ONE OF THE MOST RESPECTED AND ADMIRED FIGURES IN OUR CIVIC LANDSCAPE. DAN WAS A TRUSTED ADVISOR AND TENACIOUS ADVOCATE PARTICULARLY ON PERMITTING BUILDING REGULATIONS AND THE ISSUES THAT IMPACT OUR CITY'S HOSPITALITY AND EVENTS SECTORS. HE HAS A DEEP UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THE CITY WORKS AND MAYBE MORE IMPORTANTLY HOW IT COULD WORK BETTER. DAN Z IMPACTED IMPACT EXTENDED FAR BEYOND CITY HALL. HE PLAYED A CRITICAL ROLE IN BRINGING WORLD CLASS GOLF TOURNAMENTS TO SAN FRANCISCO INCLUDING THE 2020 PGA CHAMPIONSHIP TO HARDING PARK, ONE OF THE RARE MAJOR CHAMPIONSHIPS HELD AT A MUNICIPAL COURSE. HIS LEADERSHIP ROLES WITH THE PGA TOUR, USGA AND THE OLYMPIC CLUB WHERE HE SERVED AS PRESIDENT REFLECTED HIS LIFELONG PASSION FOR SPORTS, FOR COMMUNITY AND FOR BRINGING PEOPLE TOGETHER MORE THAN FOR HIS RESUME. HOWEVER, DAN WAS KNOWN FOR HIS WARMTH, HIS HUMOR AND THE GENUINE JOY HE BROUGHT TO EVERY ROOM HE ENTERED. HE WAS A KIND, JOVIAL AND DEEPLY LOYAL PERSON FOR THE CITY AND FOR THOSE HE LOVED. DAN LEAVES BEHIND HIS BELOVED WIFE CARA ON BEHALF OF A GRATEFUL CITY. I KNOW WE EXTEND OUR DEEPEST CONDOLENCES TO HER, TO HIS FAMILY AND FRIENDS AND TO ALL WHO HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF WORKING WITH DAN OVER THE YEARS. REST IN PEACE DAN DILLON. MAY HIS MEMORY BE A BLESSING AND THE REST I SUBMIT. >> THANK YOU. SUPERVISOR DORSEY SUPERVISOR AND GAUDIO. >> COLLEAGUES TODAY I AM REQUESTING A HEARING TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE ROOT CAUSE OF LOW LEVELS OF TRAFFIC ENFORCEMENT ACROSS OUR CITY. FIRST I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE LEADERSHIP OF TWO OF MY COLLEAGUES ON THIS ISSUE INCLUDING BOARD PRESIDENT RANDLEMAN OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS AND SUPERVISOR MEL GARTH'S LEADERSHIP AND VISION ZERO. I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE SIGNIFICANT AND MEANINGFUL STEPS TO IMPROVE STREET SAFETY OVER THE PAST DECADE BY THE S.F. MTA IN COLLABORATION WITH OTHER CITY DEPARTMENTS. BUT THEIR CHANGES CANNOT STOP FATALITIES ON THEIR OWN WITHOUT CONSISTENT AND VISIBLE ENFORCEMENT TO ENCOURAGE BEHAVIORAL CHANGE, EVEN THE BEST PREVENTATIVE INFRASTRUCTURE WILL FALL SHORT OF ITS INTENDED GOALS. IN 2014 SAN FRANCISCO SET AN AMBITIOUS GOAL TO ELIMINATE TRAFFIC FATALITIES IN 20 YEARS. BUT LAST YEAR WE REPORTED ONE OF THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF TRAFFIC FATALITIES. AT THE SAME TIME, TRAFFIC CITATIONS HAVE DROPPED BY 95% THE PAST DECADE. THIS DECREASE IN ENFORCEMENT ENABLES MANY DRIVERS TO SKIRT TRAFFIC LAWS PUTTING PEDESTRIANS, CYCLISTS AND OTHER ROAD USERS AT SERIOUS RISK. THAT'S WHY I'M CALLING FOR A HEARING TO EXAMINE THE ROOT CAUSE OF OUR DECLINING TRAFFIC ENFORCEMENT AND ITS CONNECTION TO PUBLIC SAFETY. WE NEED A CLEAR PICTURE OF HOW THE POLICE DEPARTMENT'S TRAFFIC COMPANY OPERATES TODAY HOW RESOURCES ARE ALLOCATED AND WHAT PLANS ARE IN PLACE TO REBUILD THIS CRITICAL FUNCTION WITHIN OUR POLICE DEPARTMENT. THANKS AGAIN PRESIDENT MATLIN FOR YOUR WILLINGNESS TO COLLABORATE ON THIS ISSUE. I'M ALSO INTRODUCING A RESOLUTION URGING THE CITY SERVICES AUDITOR WORK WITH SAN FRANCISCO. SAN FRANCISCO PUBLIC WORKS TO DEVELOP OBJECTIVE AND MEASURABLE STANDARDS FOR STREETSCAPE PROJECTS, OPEN SPACES AND PLANTED MEDIANS. 15 YEARS AGO SAN FRANCISCO ADOPTED THE BETTER STREETS PLAN A COHESIVE VISION TO ENSURE WE DESIGNED OUR STREETS FOR VIBRANCY FROM STREET TREES TO SEATING AND DECORATIVE ELEMENTS TO BEAUTIFUL LANDSCAPING. THESE STREETSCAPE PROJECTS HELPED COORDINATE MILLIONS OF CITY INVESTMENTS INTO COMMUNITIES. THESE INVESTMENTS ALSO HELP PROMOTE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND COMMUNITY IDENTITY AND COMMERCIAL CORRIDORS THROUGHOUT THE CITY. WE HAVE HUNDREDS OF ACRES OF CITY MANAGED PUBLIC OPEN SPACES, NATURALIZED AREAS PLANTED MEDIANS AND LANDSCAPED ASSETS. THESE SPACES PROVIDE MANY BENEFITS TO OUR RESIDENTS OFFERING SHADE RETAINING STORMWATER AND REDUCING AIR POLLUTION. YET ALL TOO OFTEN A WINTER STORM OR A VEHICLE CRASH TAKES OUT SEVERAL TREES ON A STREETSCAPE PROJECT OR AN IRRIGATION SYSTEM FAILS. SUDDENLY EVERYTHING WE INVESTED IN PUBLIC LANDSCAPING AND INFRASTRUCTURE LOOKS NEGLECTED AND IN NEED OF REPAIR. IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THIS WAY. WE HAVE SOME OF THE MOST TALENTED AND SKILLFUL WORKERS ANYWHERE IN THE COUNTRY. I KNOW WE CAN MAINTAIN THE BEAUTIFUL THINGS WE BUILT AS POLICYMAKERS. OUR CHALLENGE IS UNDERSTANDING WHAT RESOURCE IS PUBLIC WORKS NEEDS TO KEEP OUR STREETSCAPES GREEN AND WELL-MAINTAINED. THIS RESOLUTION IS A FIRST STEP. IT ASKS THE CITY TO CREATE OBJECTIVE MEASURES AND MAINTENANCE STANDARDS FOR OUR STREETSCAPES AND LANDSCAPED AREAS. >> THANK YOU COLLEAGUES AND THE REST I SUBMIT. THANK YOU. SUPERVISOR AND GUARDIOLA SUPERVISOR FIELDER. THANK YOU, MADAM CLERK. COLLEAGUES TODAY I'M INTRODUCING A RESOLUTION IN SUPPORT OF THE GOLDEN STATE VALKYRIES AND THEIR EFFORTS ALONG WITH THE WOMEN'S NATIONAL BASKETBALL PLAYERS ASSOCIATION TO SECURE A FAIR COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT AND EQUAL COMPENSATION FOR WNBA ATHLETES. THE BOUNDARIES ARE THE NEWEST FRANCHISE IN THE WNBA AND THEIR DEBUT SEASON. THEY'VE ALREADY BROKEN RECORDS WITH TEN STRAIGHT SOLD OUT GAMES AT CHASE CENTER AND HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF FANS TUNING IN. >> THEY'RE NOT JUST A TEAM. THEY'RE A MOVEMENT THAT WOMEN'S PROFESSIONAL SPORTS ARE COMMERCIALLY VIABLE, CULTURALLY POWERFUL AND HERE TO STAY. >> DESPITE THIS UNDENIABLE SUCCESS, WNBA PLAYERS STILL EARN JUST A FRACTION OF THEIR NBA COUNTERPARTS. >> MANY ARE FORCED TO PLAY OVERSEAS IN THE OFF SEASON RISKING INJURY AND EVEN THEIR SAFETY JUST TO MAKE ENDS MEET. THESE ATHLETES ARE DOING EVERYTHING RIGHT SHOWING UP, FILLING STADIUMS, SELLING OUT JERSEYS AND YET THERE'S STILL BEING UNDERPAID. LAST YEAR THE WNBA BPA EXERCISED ITS RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF THE CURRENT BARGAINING AGREEMENT. AND THIS YEAR PLAYERS ACROSS THE LEAGUE INCLUDING THE VALKYRIES MADE THEIR DEMANDS VISIBLE AND UNDENIABLE BY WEARING SHIRTS AT THE ALL-STAR GAME READING QUOTE PAY US WHAT YOU OWE US. >> THIS RESOLUTION REAFFIRMS SAN FRANCISCO'S LONGSTANDING LEADERSHIP ON GENDER EQUITY AND LABOR RIGHTS. IT'S ABOUT BACKING UP OUR VALUES WITH ACTION SUPPORTING ATHLETES WHO ARE DEMANDING WHAT EVERY WORKER DESERVES A FAIR CONTRACT THAT REFLECTS THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS AND THEIR WORTH. >> THE VALKYRIE'S PRESENCE IN SAN FRANCISCO IS MORE THAN A FRANCHISE. IT'S A CULTURAL INSTITUTION IN THE MAKING. IT'S A BEACON TO YOUNG WOMEN AND GIRLS ESPECIALLY IN THE BAY AREA WHO CAN NOW SEE THEMSELVES REFLECTED ON A PROFESSIONAL STAGE. BUT VISIBILITY IS NOT ENOUGH. REPRESENTATION MUST BE MATCHED BY EQUITY. >> I WANT TO THANK EARLY CO-SPONSORS ON THIS RESOLUTION. SUPERVISORS MAHMUD DORSEY CHEN MELGAR AND WALTON. >> I WANT TO THANK THE PLAYERS OF THE VALKYRIES AND THE WNBA FOR THEIR LEADERSHIP AND COURAGE. THIS FIGHT IS BIGGER THAN BASKETBALL. THIS IS ABOUT LABOR JUSTICE, GENDER EQUITY AND THE FUTURE OF PROFESSIONAL SPORTS. >> I URGE MY COLLEAGUES TO STAND WITH OUR HOME TEAM WITH WOMEN ATHLETES AND WITH EVERYONE WHO BELIEVES THAT EQUAL WORK DESERVES EQUAL PAY. LET'S SEND A MESSAGE LOUD AND CLEAR. >> PAY THEM WHAT THEY'RE OWED. I ALSO WANT TO INTRODUCE A RESOLUTION TODAY TO DESIGNATE AUGUST 2ND, 2025 AS PETE ESCOVEDO DAY IN HONOR OF THE BAY AREA LEGENDARY PERCUSSIONIST AND RENOWNED VISUAL ARTIST WHO HELPED UPLIFT LATIN JAZZ ON THE WEST COAST MENTORED BY TITO PUENTE AND INVITED OUR TOUR WITH THIS NORTHERN COKE BY SANTANA. PETE WAS HONORED WITH A LATIN GRAMMY LIFETIME ACHIEVEMENT AWARD IN 2021 ALONGSIDE HIS DAUGHTER SHEILA E PETE ESCOVEDO TURNED 90 YEARS OLD LAST MONTH AND IS STILL GOING STRONG. PINA'S BEEN PLAYING MUSIC AND PAINTING SINCE HE WAS IN HIS EARLY TEENS GROWING UP IN OAKLAND AND HE HAS CREATED A BODY OF WORK IN BOTH GENRES THAT IS ON ASPIRING. HE ALSO GREW UP PLAYING AT THE MISSION CULTURAL CENTER FOR LATINO ARTS DRUMMING AND EVENTS FROM THE START OF M.C. CLAY HISTORY IN THE 1970S. TO THIS DAY PETE'S WORK IS CELEBRATED RIGHT NOW AT THE MISSION CULTURAL CENTER WITH A COMPREHENSIVE AND MULTIDISCIPLINARY ART AND MUSIC EXHIBIT THAT RUNS THROUGH AUGUST 2ND, 2025 THE DAY OF THE CLOSING CEREMONY. I ENCOURAGE YOU ALL TO GO AND SEE THE BOLD TEXTURED PAINTINGS AS A REPLICA OF HIS DRUM SET. VIDEOS OF HIS MUSIC IN ACTION AND MEMORABILIA FROM HIS STORIED CAREER BEFORE THE EXHIBIT CLOSES. >> I WANT TO THANK MARTINA AYALA FROM SELAH AND EARLY CO-SPONSOR SUPERVISORS MELGAR AND WALTON. I ESPECIALLY WANT TO THANK MR. ESCOVEDO FOR HIS CONTRIBUTIONS TO MUSIC, ART AND CULTURE IN THE BAY AREA SAN FRANCISCO AND ESPECIALLY DISTRICT NINE. >> THE REST I SUBMIT. THANK YOU. SUPERVISOR FIELDER SUPERVISOR AMONG MY COLLEAGUES TODAY IT IS MY HONOR TO INTRODUCE FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER AND THE CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO A RESOLUTION DECLARING JULY 18TH TO AUGUST 17TH AS SOUTH ASIAN AMERICAN HERITAGE MONTH. >> SAN FRANCISCO IS HOME TO A VIBRANT AND GROWING SOUTH ASIAN COMMUNITY INCLUDING BOTH RECENT IMMIGRANTS AND MULTIGENERATIONAL SOUTH ASIAN AMERICANS WITH ANCESTRAL ROOTS IN AFGHANISTAN, BANGLADESH, BHUTAN, INDIA, THE MALDIVES, NEPAL, PAKISTAN AND SRI LANKA EACH CONTRIBUTING MEANINGFULLY TO THE CITY'S CIVIC, CULTURAL AND ECONOMIC FABRIC. THE PRESENCE OF SOUTH ASIAN IMMIGRANTS IN SOUTH ASIAN AMERICANS IN SAN FRANCISCO PRECEDES THE GOLD RUSH MAKING SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTIONS TO SAN FRANCISCO THROUGH THEIR LEADERSHIP AND WORK IN SMALL BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY, EDUCATION AND SO MANY OTHER SECTORS. >> TODAY MEMBERS OF THE SOUTH ASIAN COMMUNITY LIVE AND WORK ACROSS OUR CITY CONTRIBUTING TO OUR ECONOMIC VITALITY THROUGH SMALL BUSINESSES, RESTAURANTS, FAMILY RUN STORES, PROFESSIONAL SERVICES AND INNOVATION DRIVEN INDUSTRIES WHILE ENRICHING THE CULTURAL AND CIVIC FABRIC OF SAN FRANCISCO. THE SOUTH ASIAN COMMUNITY HAS ALSO FACED SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES INCLUDING EXCLUSION UNDER EARLY U.S. IMMIGRATION LAWS RACIAL AND RELIGIOUS DISCRIMINATION, SURVEILLANCE AND XENOPHOBIA. MOST NOTABLY IN THE EARLY 1900S AND THE ONSLAUGHT OF STRUCTURAL ISLAMOPHOBIA AND BROAD RACIST SENTIMENT FOLLOWING THE ATTACKS OF SEPTEMBER 11TH WHICH DEFINED AN ENTIRE ERA OF OUR HISTORY AS WELL AS ONGOING ANTI-SIKH AND ANTI-HINDU DISCRIMINATION IN THAT HAVE IMPACTED SOUTH ASIAN COMMUNITIES ACROSS LINES OF FAITH AND IDENTITY YET HAS CONTINUED TO ORGANIZE BUILD COALITIONS AND FIGHT FOR EQUITY JUSTICE AND FOR CIVIC INCLUSION. >> SOUTH ASIANS IN SAN FRANCISCO HAVE BEEN AT THE FOREFRONT OF ADVOCACY FOR IMMIGRANT RIGHTS, GENDER EQUALITY, LGBTQ I PLUS REPRESENTATION WORKERS PROTECTIONS AMONGST MANY OTHER ISSUES. >> SO COLLEAGUES, I HOPE YOU'LL JOIN ME IN RECOGNIZING SOUTH ASIAN AMERICAN HERITAGE MONTH CELEBRATING THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS AS VISIBILITY AND LIVED EXPERIENCES OF SO MANY SOUTH ASIAN RESIDENTS IN SAN FRANCISCO. I HOPE YOU'LL JOIN US WITH THE MAYOR'S PROCLAMATION TOMORROW AS WELL TOMORROW AFTERNOON. AND LASTLY I WANT TO THANK COAUTHOR CHAUDHRY FROM THE IMMIGRANT RIGHTS COMMISSION FOR HER HELP IN SPONSORING AND WRITING THIS RESOLUTION AND FOR HER WORK TOMORROW AS WELL. THE MAYOR'S PROCLAMATION AND SECOND COLLEAGUES I AM REQUESTING A HEARING TO INVESTIGATE THE CONDITIONS OF A REENTRY FACILITY AT 111 TAYLOR AND THE ONGOING ROLE OF ITS OPERATOR ICE CONTRACTOR AND PRIVATE PRISON CORPORATION GEO GROUP IN SAN FRANCISCO FOLLOWING THE DEATH OF MELVIN BALOGUN WHILE IN THE FACILITY'S CARE. >> IT'S HEARTBREAKING TO HEAR WHAT THE BALOGUN FAMILY HAS EXPERIENCED. >> NO CHILD SHOULD HAVE TO LOSE A PARENT UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES AND IT TAKES GREAT COURAGE AND STRENGTH TO TURN PAIN INTO ACTION AND ADVOCACY AND I HOPE TO GET ANSWERS. >> AT LAST WEEK'S REENTRY COUNCIL MEETING WE HEARD OF THE TRAGIC DEATH OF AN IMMIGRANT AND SAN FRANCISCO RESIDENT MELVIN BALOGUN. UNDER THE CARE OF THE HALFWAY HOUSE TAYLOR STREET FACILITY, MR. BALOGUN'S CHILDREN SPOKE OUT TO DEMAND JUSTICE AT LAST WEEK'S REENTRY COUNCIL RECOUNTING RECEIVING CALLS FROM THEIR FATHER IN DISTRESS STATING HE WOULD RATHER BE BACK IN PRISON THAN AT THIS FACILITY. >> AND SHORTLY AFTER HE WAS FOUND DEAD DECEASED ON THE STREETS OF THE TENDERLOIN. >> AFTER IDENTIFYING THEIR FATHER'S BODY, THE FAMILY CONTACTED THEIR FATHER'S PAROLE OFFICER AT GEO GROUP WHO CLAIMED THAT THEY HAD NO KNOWLEDGE THAT HE HAD LEFT THEIR FACILITIES. THIS FOLLOWS ESCALATING CONCERNS RAISED BY COMMUNITY MEMBERS DURING PUBLIC COMMENT AT THE BOARD OF APPEALS OF NEGLECT ABUSE AND CIVIL RIGHTS VIOLATIONS AT THE REENTRY FACILITY LOCATED AT 111 TAYLOR IN THE TENDERLOIN. >> FOR CONTEXT, THE FACILITY AT 111 TAYLOR IS OPERATED BY GEO GROUP, A MULTI-BILLION BILLION DOLLAR PRIVATE PRISON GROUP HOLDING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN CONTRACTS WITH ICE ACROSS THE COUNTRY. >> AND THE 111 TAYLOR SITE IS A HISTORIC SIGNIFICANCE TO THE COMMUNITY AS THE BIRTH OF THE TRANS RESISTANCE DURING THE COMPTON CAFETERIA RIOT. BUT UNFORTUNATELY IT HAS BEEN OPERATED BY GEO GROUP AS A HALFWAY HOUSE SINCE ACQUIRING THE SITE IN 1989. >> GIVEN THE ALARMING CONCERNS RAISED BY RESIDENTS, THE PURPOSE OF THIS HEARING WILL BE TO ASK QUESTIONS REGARDING LIVING CONDITIONS AT THE FACILITY AND INVESTIGATE REPORTS OF CIVIL RIGHTS VIOLATIONS. LASTLY, AS SUCH IN HONOR OF MELVIN BALOGUN, I'D LIKE TO ADJOURN OUR MEETING IN HIS MEMORY IN MEMORIAM. BEFORE COMING TO AMERICA, MELVIN SPENT HIS EARLY YEARS IN THE PHILIPPINES WHERE HIS ENERGY, JOY AND FEARLESS SPIRIT WERE IMPOSSIBLE TO MISS. AS A LITTLE BOY HE WAS FULL OF LIFE, MISCHIEVOUS AND THE MOST LOVABLE WAY. >> HE WAS ALWAYS GETTING INTO TROUBLE NOT OUT OF DEFIANCE BUT SIMPLY BECAUSE HE FOLLOWED WHATEVER BROUGHT HIM JOY. RUNNING BAREFOOT WITH FRIENDS, CLIMBING TREES IN THE PROVINCE AND EXPLORING EVERY CORNER OF HIS WORLD, MELVIN WORE HIS SCRAPES AND BRUISES LIKE TROPHIES. COVERED IN SWEAT AND DIRT. HE WOULD COME HOME BEAMING AS IF HE HAD PLAYED UNTIL THE SUN CAME UP. >> HE OFTEN JOKED THAT HE LEARNED HOW TO RUN FROM TRYING TO AVOID GETTING CASTIGATED. >> TRUE TO HIS NATURE HE WAS A JOY A NATURAL JOKESTER WHO LOVE MAKING PEOPLE LAUGH. >> THAT JOY, THAT SENSE OF FREEDOM AND FUN REMAINED A PART OF HIM EVEN AS HE GREW OLDER. >> AFTER MANY YEARS OF WAITING, HIS MOTHER MILLIE MADE IT BACK TO THE PHILIPPINES AFTER ESTABLISHING RESIDENCY IN THE UNITED STATES. >> AT JUST 11 YEARS OLD. MELVIN BEGAN A NEW CHAPTER OF LIFE RIGHT HERE IN SAN FRANCISCO. >> HE ATTENDED POTRERO HILL MIDDLE SCHOOL WHERE HE ADJUSTED TO A NEW COUNTRY WITH DETERMINATION AND GRADUATED WITH HIS HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA FROM GALILEO HIGH SCHOOL. >> DESPITE THE CHALLENGES HE KEPT HIS WARMTH, HIS HUMILITY AND HIS GIFT FOR CONNECTING WITH OTHERS. >> HE WAS ACTIVE, ENERGETIC AND FULL OF LAUGHTER WITH A QUIET STRENGTH THAT LEFT A LASTING IMPRESSION. >> HE MADE FRIENDS EASILY AND ALWAYS FOUND WAYS TO BRING JOY TO THOSE AROUND HIM. >> HE GAVE GENEROUSLY OF HIMSELF NOT ONLY THROUGH THE THINGS HE PROVIDED BUT THROUGH THE PERSON HE WAS. HE SHOWED UP. HE REMEMBERED BIRTHDAYS AND FAVORITE MEALS. HE OFFERED ADVICE WHEN NEEDED AND COMFORT WHEN WORDS FELL SHORT. >> EVEN DURING HARD TIMES HIS CHILDREN NEVER QUESTIONED WHETHER HE LOVED THEM. >> HIS PRESENCE WAS CONSTANT AND HIS DEVOTION UNWAVERING. MELVIN WAS THEIR FIRST PLACE. >> THEIR SAFE SPACE. THEIR BIGGEST SUPPORTER AND THEIR GREATEST TEACHER IN THE LESSONS THAT MATTERED MOST LOVE, ENDURANCE, HUMILITY AND JOY. MAY HIS MEMORY FOREVER BE A BLESSING AND ONE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I BELIEVE HIS FAMILY IS HERE AS WELL. >> THE REST I SUBMIT. THANK YOU. SUPERVISOR MAHMOOD SUPERVISOR MELGAR. >> HOW ARE YOUR SONS? THANK YOU, MADAM CLERK. >> I HAVE AN IN MEMORIAM AND THREE PIECES OF LEGISLATION. I WILL TRY NOT TO TALK TOO MUCH . I AM TODAY HONORING THE LIFE OF MAUREEN DOWLING, A REMARKABLE SAN FRANCISCAN AND PROUD IMMIGRANT FROM IRELAND WHO PASSED AWAY THIS WEEK. >> BORN IN 1925 IN IRELAND, MAUREEN LIVED A LIFE OF COURAGE, SERVICE AND GRACE. AT THE AGE OF 17 DURING THE HEIGHT OF WORLD WAR TWO, SHE BOARDED A SHIP BOUND FOR LONDON WHERE SHE WORKED FOR YEARS AS A NURSE CARING FOR WOUNDED SAILORS AND CIVILIANS DURING SOME OF HISTORY'S DARKEST DAYS. AFTER THE WAR SHE RETURNED HOME TO IRELAND WHERE SHE MET PATRICK DOWLING, A FELLOW ADVENTURER FROM HER VILLAGE. THE TWO MARRIED AND BEGAN THEIR JOURNEY TO AMERICA SETTLING FIRST IN EUREKA VALLEY AND THEN MADE THEIR HOME IN INGLESIDE TERRACES WHERE THEY RAISED SIX CHILDREN AND BECAME ACTIVE IN ST STEPHEN'S PARISH. MAUREEN WAS A DEVOTED MOTHER WHO ENCOURAGED HER CHILDREN TO BE INDEPENDENT AND PURSUE THEIR DREAMS. SHE WAS A FOUNDING MEMBER OF THE UNITED IRISH CULTURAL CENTER AND THE PATRICK DOWLING LIBRARY LEAVING A LEGACY OF COMMUNITY AND CULTURAL PRIDE THAT WILL ENDURE MANY GENERATIONS. >> SHE IS SURVIVED BY HER DAUGHTER CECILIA, PATRICIA, EILEEN, KATHLEEN AND COLLEEN. NINE GRANDCHILDREN, FIVE GREAT GRANDCHILDREN AND TWO GREAT GREAT GRANDCHILDREN. ON BEHALF OF THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS IN THE CITY AND COUNTY SAN FRANCISCO, WE'D LIKE TO EXPRESS OUR DEEPEST CONDOLENCES TO THE DOWNIE FAMILY. MAY SHE REST IN PEACE. >> COLLEAGUES EARLIER THIS SPRING I SHARED DRAFTING A REQUEST TO PROVIDE A PROACTIVE PLAN FOR THE PENDING REZONING PACKAGE THAT IS INTRODUCED BY THE MAYOR TO THIS BOARD. WE WILL BE CONSIDERING IT IN THE FALL TO MEET OUR OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS IN THE HOUSING ELEMENT. I AM TODAY INTRODUCING THE FIRST PART OF A REZONING RESPONSE IN READINESS PACKAGE. AS ONE OF THE SUPERVISORS WHO REPRESENTS THE WEST SIDE WHICH COMPRISES MOST OF THIS NEWLY ZONED AREA IS IMPORTANT TO ME THAT WE PROTECT EXISTING RENT CONTROLLED UNITS. WHILE WE ENCOURAGE SMART DEVELOPMENT OF HOUSING TO MEET THE DIFFERENT NEEDS OF RESIDENTS ACROSS THE SPECTRUM IN I BELIEVE WE CAN DO BOTH. >> WE NEED A RANGE OF OPTIONS THAT I'M SORRY I'M SO SORRY I'M JUST HAVING COMPUTER PROBLEMS HERE. WE NEED A RANGE OF OPTIONS TO MEET THE DIFFERENT HOUSING REQUIREMENTS THAT OUR RESIDENTS NEED. >> A LARGE PART FOR A LARGE PART OF OUR HISTORY WE HAVE NOT FOCUSED ON ADDING NEW UNITS ON THE WEST SIDE AFFORDABLE OR OTHERWISE. AND IT IS NOW THE TIME TO BE CREATIVE IN SERVING THE DIFFERENT NEEDS OF DIFFERENT HOUSEHOLD. THE FIRST PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT I'M BRINGING FORWARD IS AN EXPANSION OF THE OPTIONS UNDER INCLUSIONARY ORDINANCE FOR THE WELL-RESOURCED NEIGHBORHOODS SO THAT DEVELOPERS HAVE DIFFERENT WAYS TO MEET THAT OBLIGATION. DEVELOPERS WILL BE ABLE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN INCLUDING THE REQUIRED BELOW MARKET RATE UNITS WITHIN THEIR DEVELOPMENT PAYING THE INCLUSIONARY FEE OR DEDICATING LAND JUST LIKE WE HAVE IN THE EASTERN NEIGHBORHOODS PLAN. ANOTHER OPTION ALSO WILL BE TO MAKE ALL OF THEIR UNITS IN THEIR BUILDINGS SUBJECT TO RENT CONTROL FROM THE GET GO. I BELIEVE WE NEED TO EXPAND THE TOOLS TO BRING RENTAL HOUSING TO THE WEST SIDE AS WELL AS ADDRESS THE REAL PROBLEM THAT OUR RENT CONTROL STOCK IS DIMINISHING OVER TIME. >> WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO POTENTIALLY CREATE NEW RENT CONTROLLED UNITS WHICH WILL HELP US SUSTAIN AFFORDABILITY OVER TIME. >> THE OTHER KEY TO MAKING THIS PLAN WORK IS FINDING WAYS TO ADD TO OUR AFFORDABLE HOUSING STOCK AND THE FINANCING. FOR TOO LONG WE HAVE RELIED ON TAX CREDITS AND INCLUSIONARY FEES FOR MARKET RATE DEVELOPMENTS WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO THE WHIMS OF THE MARKET. WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT THE PRODUCTION OF UNITS IS COUNTERCYCLICAL. WHEN WE HAVE GOOD TIMES IN THE MARKET THOSE FEES ARE BEING PAID INTO THE FUND BUT THEN LAND BECOMES REALLY EXPENSIVE AND NONPROFIT DEVELOPERS HAVE TO COMPETE WITH FOR PROFIT DEVELOPERS FOR THE ACQUISITION OF LAND. WE NEED NEW FINANCING TOOLS THAT ARE COUNTER-CYCLICAL SO THAT WE CAN CAPTURE SOME OF THE NEW VALUE OF THE TREES OWN PROPERTIES TO BENEFIT BUILDING FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. I'M INTRODUCING A RESOLUTION TO EXPRESS INTEREST IN THE FORMATION OF AN ENHANCED INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCE DISTRICT FOR WELL-RESOURCED NEIGHBORHOODS FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING CREATION THAT ENCOMPASSES THE REUSE OWNED AREAS. THIS IS A LONG TERM STRATEGY THAT WILL USE THE INCREMENTAL INCREASES OF FUTURE PROPERTY TAXES FROM THESE REZONING PROPERTIES TO REINVEST IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS. >> THERE ARE A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS APPROACH. WE'VE NEVER DONE IT BEFORE AND IT IS TIME TO BE CREATIVE. THIS RESOLUTION REQUESTS THE COMPTROLLER AND THE MAYOR'S OFFICE OF ECONOMIC AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AS WELL AS THE MAYOR'S OFFICE OF HOUSING TO PROVIDE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR US THIS FALL TO CRUNCH THE NUMBERS AND TO EXPLORE OPTIONS WITH US SO THAT WE CAN EXPLORE THIS FINANCING TOOL TOWARDS OUR COLLECTIVE GOAL. LASTLY, I AM INTRODUCING LEGISLATION TO ESTABLISH A SMALL BUSINESS REZONING CONSTRUCTION RELIEF FUND AND PROGRAM SO THAT WE CAN BE PROACTIVE ABOUT THE POTENTIAL RELOCATION AND OR CONSTRUCTION IMPACTS WHEN REZONING PROJECTS COME TO FRUITION. THIS CAME FROM A STUDY I REQUESTED FROM THE BUDGET AND LEGISLATIVE ANALYST A YEAR AND A HALF AGO NOW THAT RECOMMENDED A MORE TARGETED APPROACH TO PREPARE FOR ANY EFFECTS CAUSED BY DEVELOPMENT. I WANT TO THANK DIRECTOR KATIE TANG AND HER TEAM FOR THEIR INPUT AND THE SMALL BUSINESS ADVOCATES WHO HAVE ACTIVELY CALLED FOR MORE SUPPORT. AGAIN THIS IS ONE OF THE PIECE MANY PIECES THAT WE ARE DEVELOPING AS WELL AS TOOLS TO PREVENT THE WHOLESALE WHOLESALE DISPLACEMENT OF OUR BELOVED SMALL BUSINESS BUSINESSES. WE NEED OUR STATE LEGISLATURE TO PROVIDE MORE PROTECTIONS AND SUPPORT AS WELL. THANK YOU COLLEAGUES FOR LISTENING TO THIS PACKAGE AND I EXPECT A ROBUST DISCUSSION WHEN THE TIME COMES SO WE CAN COLLECTIVELY DEVELOP OUR RESPONSE. THE REST I SUBMIT. THANK YOU. SUPERVISOR MELGAR. SUPERVISOR SUTTER. SUBMIT. THANK YOU. SUPERVISOR CHERYL SUBMIT. THANK YOU. SUPERVISOR WALTON. SUBMIT. >> THANK YOU. SUPERVISOR CHIN. THANK YOU, MADAM CLERK. >> COLLEAGUES, I KNOW THERE'S NO DEBATE WHEN WE SAY THAT LOCAL BUSINESS ARE THE BACKBONE OF OUR ECONOMY. >> THIS BOARD HAS TIME AND AGAIN FOUND WAYS TO SUPPORT OUR SMALL BUSINESSES THROUGH PROGRAMS LIKE FIRST YEAR FREE TO LEGACY BUSINESS AND NEIGHBORHOOD ANGERING BUSINESS REGISTRY. AND WE DEDICATE OUR RESOURCES AND SUPPORT TO RECOGNIZE THEM AND SUPPORT THEM. LOCAL BUSINESS. OUR COMMUNITY SPACES AS MUCH AS THEY ARE PLACES OF COMMERCE AND SERVICES WE SUPPORT THEM BECAUSE THEY HAVE GREAT PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. BUT WE ALL KNOW IT FOR ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE OF US FORTUNATE TO HAVE NEIGHBOR COMMERCIAL CORRIDORS, WE KNOW THAT IT IS ALL ABOUT THE PEOPLE THE PEOPLE THAT OPERATE THEM AND MAKE IT WORK. BUT EVEN AS WE RECOVER FROM PANDEMIC, WE KNOW THAT MANY OF OUR BUSINESSES AND WORKERS ARE FACING UNCERTAINTY FROM THE PRESSURE WITH TARIFFS TO THE UPCOMING LOCAL UP ZONING PLAN. >> SO TO PROVIDE SUPPORT TO OUR BUSINESSES AND WORKERS I'M ANNOUNCING TWO PIECES OF LEGISLATION TODAY AS A PACKAGE THAT I HOPE THAT WE CAN SUPPORT OUR LOCAL BUSINESSES AND WORKERS TO GATHER. THE FIRST IS FOR AN ORDINANCE TO EXTEND EXISTING INTERIM ZONING CONTROL INTO A PERMANENT ORDINANCE WHICH WOULD REQUIRE CONDITIONAL USE AUTHORIZATION WHENEVER A NEW BUSINESS ATTEMPT TO DISPLACE A LEGACY BUSINESS. AND I ALSO HOPE TO EXPAND IT INTO A NEIGHBORHOOD ANGERING BUSINESS. THESE MOM AND POP SHOPS MAKE SAN FRANCISCO MAKE SAN FRANCISCO AND NEIGHBORHOODS UNIQUE AND ARE WHY SAN FRANCISCANS HAVE SO MUCH PRIDE IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS THAT WE LIVE SO MUCH SO THAT SOMETIMES BECOMES A COMPETITION. INDEED WE KNOW IT. YET DUE TO STATE LAW PREVENTION WHICH BROADLY DEFINES COMMERCIAL RENT CONTROL, THE SMALL BUSINESS COMMUNITY CONTINUES TO FACE ONGOING UNCERTAINTY AND A THREAT OF DISPLACEMENT OFTEN AT THE WHIM OF RAPIDLY RISING RENT. A ESPECIALLY AS THE MARKET ANTICIPATES FURTHER REAL ESTATE SPECULATION. NOW WE ALL KNOW THOUGH WHEN A BUSINESS IS FACING A TRANSITIONS THE WORKERS ARE PART OF THE EQUATION. THEY SHOULD BE PART OF THE EQUATION. THEY FACE THE SAME CHALLENGES AS THE BUSINESS OWNERS WHEN THEY TRYING TO TRANSITION THEIR BUSINESS AS WELL. SO THE SECOND PIECE OF LEGISLATION I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE IS THE WORKERS OPPORTUNITY TO PURCHASE ACT TO CREATE A PATHWAY FOR EXISTING WORKERS TO PURCHASE A BUSINESS AS A COOPERATIVE WHEN THE OWNER INTENDS TO SELL. THIS LEGISLATION IS A TOOL WILL HELP CONTINUE TO SUPPORT BUSINESS AND WORKERS AS THEY FIND WAYS TO TRANSITION THEIR FUTURE. WE WANT TO EMPOWER OUR WORKERS TO HAVE A COLLABORATIVE CONVERSATION AND WITH THEIR BUSINESS OWNERS. WHEN A BUSINESS CLOSES THE NEIGHBORHOOD LOSES A TREASURE INSTITUTION AND WORKERS ALSO SUFFER. THE WORKERS OPPORTUNITY TO PURCHASE ACT WILL SUPPORT LONGTIME BUSINESS OWNERS WITH A SUCCESSION PLAN. SUPPORT WORKERS AND EMPOWER THEM TO BECOME ENTREPRENEURS AND STABILIZE OUR BELOVED NEIGHBORHOODS. COMMERCIAL CORRIDORS. >> AGAIN, THESE ARE LEGISLATIVE TOOLS THAT WE WANT TO PROVIDE BUSINESS AND WORKERS AND REALLY KEEP THEM WHERE THEY'RE AT SO THAT THEY CAN CONTINUE TO THRIVE. AND I HOPE TO HAVE YOUR SUPPORT COLLEAGUES WHEN THEY COME BEFORE YOU THIS FALL TO THIS FALL THIS YEAR AND THE REST I SUBMIT THANK YOU. >> THANK YOU, SUPERVISOR CHAN. SUPERVISOR CHIN SUBMIT. THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT. ROLL CALL LAST FOR THE BEST. >> BEST FOR LAST. THANK YOU, MADAM CLERK. I HAVE A COUPLE OF RESOLUTIONS AND AN IN MEMORIAM AND IF THAT IS ALL RIGHT WITH SUPERVISOR DORSEY I WOULD ASK TO BE ADDED TO HIS IN MEMORIAM FOR DAN DILLON AS WELL. ALL RIGHT. MY FIRST RESOLUTION COLLEAGUES AS YOU MAY RECALL BACK IN 2023 DISTRICTS SIX SUPERVISOR MATT DORSEY AUTHORED A RESOLUTION DECLARING JULY 28TH AND 29TH TAYLOR SWIFT WEEKEND IN SAN FRANCISCO BECAUSE MISS SWIFT WAS PERFORMING IN SANTA CLARA. >> NOW TONIGHT THE ONE AND ONLY LADY GAGA WILL BE BRINGING HER CRITICALLY ACCLAIMED MAYHEM BALL TOUR TO SAN FRANCISCO'S CHASE CENTER WHERE SHE WILL BE JOINED BY THOUSANDS OF LITTLE MONSTERS INCLUDING A FEW OF MY LEGISLATIVE AIDES. AS SHE PERFORMS HER NEW HITS ABRACADABRA. >> VANISH INTO YOU? AND HOW BAD DO YOU WANT ME? IT HAS BEEN POINTED OUT THAT IT WOULD BE A GREAT WRONG FOR THIS BODY HAVING CHOSEN TO RECOGNIZE MS.. SWIFT FOR HER SANTA CLARA PERFORMANCES NOT AT THE VERY LEAST. SIMILARLY TO RECOGNIZE GAGA ON THE OCCASION OF HER SAN FRANCISCO PERFORMANCES. >> THE RESOLUTION I'M INTRODUCING TODAY WILL AVOID THAT WRONG BY RECOGNIZING JULY 22ND, 2025 AS LADY GAGA DAY IN THE CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO. I WANT TO THANK GAGA FOR BRINGING THE ART OF PERSONAL CHAOS AND MAYHEM TO SAN FRANCISCO. AND I WANT TO THANK LITTLE MONSTER CALVIN FOR INSISTING THAT THIS BODY GET THIS RIGHT ALSO. >> COLLEAGUES, I'M INTRODUCING A RESOLUTION TO RECOGNIZE AUGUST 4TH THROUGH AUGUST 20TH THROUGH AUGUST 8TH, 2025 AS NATIONAL HEALTH CENTER WEEK IN SAN FRANCISCO FORMED IN 1982, THE SAN FRANCISCO COMMUNITY CLINIC CONSORTIUM IS A SHINING EXAMPLE OF THE COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTER LEGACY BORN OUT OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT OF THE 1960S. THESE CENTERS SEEK TO SERVE THE UNDERSERVED AT A COST THEY CAN AFFORD. TODAY THE CLINIC A CONSORTIUM IS COMPOSED OF 12 MEMBER CLINICS THAT TAILOR THEIR SERVICES TO MEET THE UNIQUE NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY IN WHICH THEY ARE LOCATED. SAN FRANCISCO'S COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS HAVE DELIVERED CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE CARE AND IMPROVED LINGUISTIC ACCESS TO MORE THAN 10% OF THE CITY'S POPULATION. FOR THEIR PATIENTS THESE CENTERS ARE OFTEN THEIR ONLY ACCESS TO PRIMARY CARE. THE RESOLUTION ACKNOWLEDGES SAN FRANCISCO'S HEALTH CENTERS AND THEIR ONGOING EFFORTS TO DELIVER INDIVIDUALIZED MEDICAL CARE TO THOSE WHO MIGHT NOT OTHERWISE HAVE IT. EVEN IN EVEN AN INCREASINGLY CHALLENGING TIMES, I WANT TO THANK JEAN ALON OF THE SAN FRANCISCO COMMUNITY CLINIC CONSORTIUM FOR WORKING WITH US ON THIS RESOLUTION. AS WELL AS SUPERVISORS WALTON MELGAR, CHERYL CHAN CHEN AND ENGARDIO DORSI AND SAUTER FOR THEIR CO-SPONSORSHIP. AND I WANT TO THANK BRAD PHELPS IN MY OFFICE FOR HIS WORK ON THIS INTRODUCTION.

TODAY I'M PROUD TO RETURN WITH A RENEWED RESOLUTION FOR AUGUST 2025 MARKING THE SECOND TIME OUR CITY FORMALLY HONORS THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF AFRICAN AMERICANS. THIS CONTINUED RECOGNITION REFLECTS SAN FRANCISCO'S EVOLVING COMMITMENT TO INCLUSION AND JUSTICE. AND I WANT TO SINCERELY THANK ALL 11 SUPERVISORS WHO CO-SPONSORED THIS RESOLUTION AND A HEARTFELT GRATITUDE TO MY SUPERVISOR SUPERVISOR MATT DORSEY WHOSE STEADFAST COMMITMENT AND UNWAVERING SUPPORT HAVE BEEN A BEACON OF HOPE AND SOLIDARITY FOR MY COMMUNITY.

THIS RESOLUTION IS NOT JUST CEREMONIAL. IT'S PERSONAL. IT'S FOR THE PARENTS WHO'VE LAID THE FOUNDATION FOR A BRIGHTER FUTURE. IT'S FOR THE REFUGEES WHO CAME DRIVEN BY RESILIENCE AND A HOPE FOR A BETTER FUTURE. AND AS FOR THE AFGHAN AMERICANS WHO HAVE LIVED HERE FOR DECADES WITHOUT EVER SEEING THEMSELVES REFLECTED IN THE DECISIONS THAT ARE MADE IN THIS DOME, THIS IS MORE THAN A SYMBOLIC GESTURE.

OUR IDENTITIES HAVE LIVED QUIETLY IN THE FOOD WE SHARE, THE WAY WE EAT OUR FOOD, THE IMMIGRANT JOURNEYS WE HAVE HAD ,THE LANGUAGES WE SPEAK AT HOME. THE HOLIDAYS WE CELEBRATE BEHIND CLOSED DOORS BUT RARELY HAVE THEY BEEN SEEN, NAMED OR AFFIRMED BY THE SAN FRANCISCO GOVERNMENT. THIS RESOLUTION BEGINS TO CHANGE THAT. IT TELLS THE SOUTH ASIAN COMMUNITY THAT YOU BELONG IN THE STORY OF SAN FRANCISCO NOT JUST SOCIALLY OR ECONOMICALLY BUT CIVICALLY. >> I'VE HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF WORKING WITH SUPERVISOR MAHMOOD AND HIS TEAM ON THIS EFFORT. AND I KNOW FIRSTHAND HOW DEEPLY MEANINGFUL THIS IS TO THE SOUTH ASIANS OF THIS CITY. >> IT OPENS THE DOOR TO CITY SPONSORED CULTURAL PROGRESS JAMMING LANGUAGE ACCESS FOR OUR ELDERS AND VISIBILITY FOR YOUNG PEOPLE WHO HAVE NEVER SEEN THEIR HERITAGE REFLECTED AT THE CITY LEVEL.

THIS ORDINANCE GIVES WORKERS A REAL SHOT AT OWNERSHIP. THIS ORDINANCE GIVES THEM THE TOOLS TO DO JUST THAT AND IT CREATES A PATHWAY FOR WORKER COOPERATIVES, PROVIDES CRITICAL LEGAL AND FINANCIAL SUPPORT AND ENSURES THAT EVERY BUSINESS HAS A UNION. THOSE RIGHTS REMAIN PROTECTED. IT HONORS THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF LONGTIME BUSINESS OWNERS BY PRESERVING THEIR LEGACY AND IT HELPS KEEP SAN FRANCISCO'S COMMERCIAL CORRIDORS ROOTED IN PEOPLE NOT JUST PROFITS. >> THIS ORDINANCE IS A COMMUNITY CENTERED APPROACH TO PREVENTING SPECULATION, ASSET STRIPPING AND DISPLACEMENT IN OUR NEIGHBORHOODS.

WE'RE HELD UP AS A MODEL MINORITY A DESIGNATION THAT PITS US AGAINST COMMUNITIES, OTHER COMMUNITIES OF COLOR IN A CIVILIZATION BUILT ON $45 TRILLION WORTH OF WEALTH STOLEN FROM OUR MOTHER LANDS OVER CENTURIES OF COLONIAL RULE WE ARE RATED THE WEALTHIEST SUBGROUP IN THE U.S. WHICH SHOULD REALLY BE SEEN AS A TESTAMENT TO THE BRUTAL AND INEQUITABLE FILTERING PROCESS BY WHICH INDIANS ARE ALLOWED TO BECOME AMERICANS. MOST COME HERE ON HB ONE H1-B SKILLED WORKER VISAS. THEY WERE BEFORE THEY WERE WORKING 60 TO 70 HOURS TO KEEP THEIR SILICON VALLEY TECH JOBS. AS LOSING IT WOULD PUT THEM ON A TIMER FOR DEPORTATION. THEY WERE AMONG MILLIONS OF INDIAN STUDENTS FIGHTING TO BE TOP OF THEIR CLASS IN A COMPETITIVE SYSTEM THAT PERPETUATES ITS OWN DEEP ROOTED SYSTEMIC INEQUALITIES. MEANWHILE, ECONOMIC REFUGEES AND THOSE FACING CASTE AND RELIGIOUS DISCRIMINATION ARE PLENTIFUL AMONG THOSE WHO SEEK AMERICAN CITIZENSHIP. YET THEY'RE JUST A SMALL FRACTION OF INDIANS ALLOWED INTO THIS COUNTRY BY SUPPORTING THIS RESOLUTION. >> YOU AFFIRM THAT SOUTH ASIAN-AMERICAN STORIES AND CONTRIBUTIONS ARE INTEGRAL TO OUR CITY NOT JUST OUR MUSIC BUT ALSO OUR VOICES NOT JUST OUR FOOD BUT ALSO OUR HISTORIES NOT JUST OUR WORK BUT ALSO THE WELL-BEING AND THE WELL-BEING OF OUR COMMUNITIES. >> THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS. >> WELCOME TO OUR NEXT SPEAKER . >> GOOD AFTERNOON. I'M PAULA EISNER, A TRANSACTIONAL ATTORNEY SPECIALIZING IN COOPERATIVES. MY LAW FIRM TUTTLE LAW GROUP IS BASED HERE IN SAN FRANCISCO. AS SOMEBODY WHO HELPED DRAFT THE WORKERS OPPORTUNITY TO PURCHASE ACT, I THANK SUPERVISOR CHAN FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. WOLPERT GIVES WORKERS THE RIGHT TO PURCHASE THEIR BUSINESSES AT MARKET VALUE BEFORE SALE TO THIRD PARTIES CREATES NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR MAJORITY GROUPS OF WORKERS TO PURCHASE THEIR BUSINESSES AND INCENTIVIZES COOPERATIVE CONVERSIONS. >> WOLPERT BUILDS ON S.F. SCOPE FOR THE COMMUNITY TO PURCHASE ACT AS WELL AS EXISTING CALIFORNIA COOPERATIVE LAW WHOPPER ISN'T JUST GOOD PUBLIC POLICY WELL BUT WILL BE A GAME CHANGER STABILIZING COMMUNITIES, EMPLOYMENT AND THE CITY'S TAX BASE WORKERS TAX BASE STABILIZATION EFFECTS MAY MAKE WAPA A REVENUE GENERATING ORDINANCE. >> WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE ACTION TO PROTECT THE CITY'S ECONOMY AT A CRUCIAL HISTORIC MOMENT A GENERATION OF SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS ARE RETIRING AND SPECULATIVE BUYERS WITH NO TIES TO THE CITY EXERT OUTSIZE INFLUENCE ON THE CITY'S WORKERS ECONOMY AND CULTURE. >> EXTRACTIVE PRACTICES SUCH AS ASSET STRIPPING THREATEN WORKERS AND THE CITY. >> RIGHT NOW OWNERS CAN SELL A BUSINESS FOR PARTS WITHOUT CONSIDERATION FOR THE WORKERS OR THE ROLE THAT BUSINESS HAS IN THE CITY. WALKER OFFERS ANOTHER PATH FOR THE CITY WHERE WORKERS HAVE THE NOTICE FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE AND ENFORCEABLE RIGHTS TO PURCHASE THE BUSINESSES THEY'VE HELPED BUILD BEFORE THEY ARE SOLD TO THIRD PARTIES. >> LOPEZ COOPERATIVE CONVERSION INCENTIVES AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT WILL FACILITATE ALL TRANSITIONS TO COOPERATIVE EMPLOYEE OWNERSHIP EMPOWERING WORKERS, SAVING CITY JOBS AND ALLOWING OWNERS TO RETIRE WITH DIGNITY KNOWING THEIR LEGACY IS IN GOOD HANDS. THANK YOU TO SUPERVISOR CHAN FOR BRINGING THIS PROPOSAL FORWARD AND I URGE YOU ALL TO SUPPORT THIS PROPOSAL TO KEEP OWNERSHIP LOCAL. I YIELD MY TIME AND ALSO SUPPORT JUSTICE FOR MELVIN. I'M TRAGIC TO HEAR THAT THIS WAS DONE FOR PROFIT. THANK YOU. >> THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS. WELCOME TO OUR NEXT SPEAKER. I HAVE SOMETHING. >> GOOD EVENING. MY NAME IS JOY GEORGE AND I INTERN WITH THE SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIES LAW CENTER. >> I'M HERE TO STRONGLY SUPPORT THE WORKERS OPPORTUNITY TO PROTECT ACT A PROPOSED ORDINANCE THAT WAS DRAFTED BY MY TEAM AND I AND IN GRATITUDE I THANK SUPERVISOR CHAN FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. >> SAN FRANCISCO IS A CITY THAT ASPIRES TO BE A LANDING PLACE FOR INNOVATION, CREATIVITY AND COMMUNITY. >> HOWEVER, AT A TIME WHERE MANY OF THE CITY'S REVITALIZATION EFFORTS ARE CENTERED ON ATTRACTING NEW BUSINESSES, THE WORKERS OF MANY SMALL BUSINESSES THAT CURRENTLY OPERATE IN THE CITY FACE INCREASING INSECURITY BECAUSE THE SMALL BUSINESS LANDSCAPE IS SHIFTING FAST, LONGTIME OWNERS ARE RETIRING AND TOO OFTEN THEIR LEGACY IS LOST TO CHAIN TAKEOVERS OR SPECULATIVE BUYERS WITH NO TIES TO THE COMMUNITY. THIS HARMS NOT ONLY SAN FRANCISCANS WHO LOSE PIECES OF THEIR CULTURAL AND ECONOMIC FABRIC BUT IT MAKES IT HARDER FOR WORKERS WHO RUN THE CITY TO STAY IN THE CITY. I AM IN SUPPORT OF LOBO BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT SUPPORTING WORKER SELF-DETERMINATION IS COMMON SENSE POLICY GIVING WORKERS THE OPPORTUNITY TO ORGANIZE THEMSELVES, RAISE CAPITAL AND BY THEIR WORKPLACES IS EXACTLY THE TYPE OF INNOVATION NEEDED TO KEEP SAN FRANCISCANS IN SAN FRANCISCO. >> THIS ORDINANCE REINFORCES A VISION OF NEIGHBORHOOD STABILIZATION WHERE STOREFRONTS DON'T FLIP EVERY FEW YEARS AND WORKING CLASS COMMUNITIES CAN REMAIN ROOTED. >> IT ENSURES THAT LAND USE AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT MOVE TOGETHER TO PRESERVE LOCAL CHARACTER WELL BUT ALSO SUPPORT BUSINESS SUCCESSION PLANNING IN A MEANINGFUL WAY. >> IT LETS SMALL BUSINESSES THEIR OWNERS RETIRE WITH DIGNITY KNOWING THEIR LIFE'S WORK WILL CONTINUE IN THE HANDS OF PEOPLE THEY TRUST THEIR WORKERS. I URGE YOU TO CONSIDER THIS ORDINANCE SERIOUSLY BECAUSE ECONOMIC RESILIENCE SHOULD BE A TOP PRIORITY FOR THIS BOARD. >> WORKER OWNED BUSINESSES ARE MORE STABLE, MORE EQUITABLE AND MORE INVESTED IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS THEY SERVE. WOBA IS A TOOL TO STRENGTHEN SAN FRANCISCO'S ECONOMY FROM THE BOTTOM UP. YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS MATTER IS WELCOMED AND I KNOW WILL SHAPE SAN FRANCISCO'S FUTURE FOR THE BETTER. >> THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS AND WE'LL COME TO OUR NEXT SPEAKER. >> HELLO SUPERVISORS. MY NAME IS NADIR AMON. I AM A DISTRICT ONE RESIDENT AND I AM HERE TO COMMENT ON THE SOUTH ASIAN HERITAGE MONTH RESOLUTION. >> THANK YOU TO SUPERVISOR MAHMUD FOR INTRODUCING THE RESOLUTION AND TO CUADRAT CHAUDHARY COUNTLESS FOR WORKING ON THIS EFFORT WITH HIS OFFICE OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS AS SOMEONE OF THIS HERITAGE IT IS FRUSTRATING THAT SOUTH ASIANS ARE OFTEN FLATTENED INTO TEXAS TECH EXCLUSIVE ARCHETYPES OF THE ENGINEER OR THE C-SUITE EXECUTIVE HERE IN SAN FRANCISCO WE ARE SO MUCH MORE THAN THAT AND SOUTH ASIAN HISTORY WITHIN SAN FRANCISCO IS DEEP AND RICH IN VARIATION SO I THOUGHT I WOULD COME HERE AND SHARE SOME SOUTH ASIAN S.F. HISTORY THAT YOU MAY NOT KNOW ABOUT ONE DURING WORLD WAR TWO GUJARAT THE HOTEL WORKERS DEMONSTRATED SOLIDARITY WITH THEIR JAPANESE EMPLOYERS AT THE TIME THE US GOVERNMENT TURNED AGAINST ITS OWN CITIZENS AND HELD THEM IN INTERNMENT CAMPS. >> THOSE WORKERS BECAME CARETAKERS OF THE BUSINESSES UNTIL THEIR EMPLOYERS RETURNED HOME TO THE HINDUSTAN HAD OTHER PARTY A REVOLUTIONARY ANTI-COLONIAL MOVEMENT IN THE EARLY 1900S FOCUSED ON LIBERATING SOUTH ASIA FROM BRITISH RULE HAD A NUMBER OF MEETING PLACES THROUGHOUT SAN FRANCISCO AND PRINTED ITS NEWSLETTER RIGHT HERE ON VALENCIA STREET AND THREE CECCONI A NONPROFIT REPRESENTING LGBTQ PLUS PEOPLE OF SOUTH ASIAN DESCENT WAS FOUNDED IN SAN FRANCISCO IN 1986 AND IS THE OLDEST GROUP OF ITS KIND IN THE WORLD. AND THAT'S JUST SCRATCHING THE SURFACE. WE ARE ACTIVISTS AND ARTISTS DOCTORS AND HEALERS, WORKERS, RESTAURATEURS, SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS AND MUCH, MUCH MORE WHO ARE A CORE PART OF SAN FRANCISCO. >> SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS. WELCOME TO OUR NEXT SPEAKER. GOOD AFTERNOON BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. MY NAME IS ANDREW JASON DE LEON. I AM MELVIN BALDWIN'S ELDEST CHILD AND ONLY SON. I HAVE WORKED IN OUR CITY AND COMMUNITY BASED PROGRAM TO SUPPORT SYSTEMS INVOLVED FAMILIES LIKE MINE. I'VE SEEN FIRSTHAND THE BEAUTY AND THE JOY THAT HAPPENS WHEN WE CENTER COMMUNITY HEALING, LOVE AND SUPPORT. JULY 14TH WAS OUR FATHER'S BIRTHDAY BUT HIS FINAL WORDS WILL HAUNT ME FOREVER. ON JULY 13TH HE WAS UNRAVELING AFTER BEING TRANSFERRED FROM THE STATE HOSPITAL IN THE TASK, CORDERO TO THE PRIVATELY RUN 111 TAYLOR STREET FACILITY RUN BY GEO GROUP HE CALLED US HIS VOICE CRACKING BREATH SHALLOW. I'M ANXIOUS, HE SAID. I'M SCARED, HE SAID I'D RATHER GO BACK TO JAIL THAN STAY HERE . HE SOUNDED LIKE A MAN CORNERED LIKE SOMEONE DROWNING WITH NO HAND REACHING BACK. >> I CALLED THE 111 TAYLOR FACILITY THREE TIMES BEGGING FOR A WELLNESS CHECK. THEY HUNG UP ON ME THREE TIMES BEFORE I WAS ABLE TO COMPLETE A SENTENCE AROUND 3:30 A.M. THE NEXT DAY MY DAD WAS FOUND DEAD ON THE PAVEMENT NEAR TO 25. TAYLOR JUST ONE BLOCK FROM THE BUILDING WHERE HE SAID HE WAS TOO AFRAID TO SLEEP. NOT ONLY DO WE HAVE TO GRIEVE OUR FATHER'S DEATH, WE MUST NOW SEEK ANSWERS ON HIS BEHALF. I FIND IT HARD TO SLEEP. FOOD HAS LOST HIS FLAVOR. MUSIC NOW SOUNDS MUTED HOW I UNDERSTAND A PUBLIC GOOD IS BASED AROUND A SAN FRANCISCO THAT IS ROOTED NOT ONLY IN TRAUMA INFORMED SYSTEMS BUT HEALING CENTERED SUPPORT AROUND THE IDEA THAT PROGRAMS ARE MEANT TO AFFIRM THE INNATE HUMAN DIGNITY THAT EXISTS WITHIN US ALL. >> THE PROGRAM AT 111 TAYLOR IS INCONGRUENT WITH THIS IDEA OF THE PUBLIC GOOD. IT IS MY DEEPEST HOPE THAT IN THE INTEREST OF THE PUBLIC GOOD THAT THE MORAL ARC OF SAN FRANCISCO WILL BEND TOWARD JUSTICE. AND AS WE CONTINUE TO RAISE PUBLIC CONSCIOUSNESS AROUND THE SUFFERING THAT THOSE THOSE LIVING AT 111 TAYLOR THAT IN DUE TIME THE SPACE BE TRANSFORMED TO ONE THAT CENTERS COMMUNITY HEALING, LOVE AND SUPPORT OUR COMMUNITIES DESERVE BETTER. >> OUR FAMILIES DESERVE BETTER. OUR DAD DESERVED BETTER. THANK YOU. SUPERVISOR MAHMOOD JUSTICE TO MELVIN THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS. >> WELCOME TO OUR NEXT SPEAKER . >> HELLO TO THE MEMBERS OF THE SAN FRANCISCO BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. MY NAME IS ANIKA, MY BYLINE. I AM ONE OF MELVIN BROWN'S CHILDREN TODAY I JUST WANT TO SPEAK ABOUT WHO MY DAD WAS AS A PERSON NOT AS A STATISTIC, NOT AS A MAN WITH A RECORD, NOT AS SOMEONE WHO FELL THROUGH THE CRACKS OF THE SYSTEM BUT AS MY FATHER AND AS A HUMAN BEING. >> MY DAD WAS SOMEONE WHO LOVED DEEPLY EVEN IF HE DIDN'T ALWAYS KNOW HOW TO SHOW IT THE WAY THE WORLD EXPECTED HIM TO. HE WAS FUNNY. HE WAS GENTLE WHEN HE WANTED TO BE AND HE HAD A CHILDLIKE SPIRIT THAT WOULD SHINE THROUGH ESPECIALLY WHEN HE WAS WITH US HIS KIDS. HE WAS IMPERFECT BUT HE WAS PRESENT. HE SHOWED UP IN THE SMALL WAYS THAT MATTERED. WHEN WE WERE LITTLE HE WOULD TAKE US AROUND SAN FRANCISCO SUCH AS TO PLACES LIKE CHINATOWN AND UBER GOING TO HE WAS TRYING TO GIVE US THE MEMORIES HE NEVER HAD GROWING UP. >> I REMEMBER HIM TRYING TO TEACH ME HOW TO SHOOT FREE THROWS AT THE PARK EVEN WAKING UP EARLY FOR MORNING JOGS TOGETHER. HE DIDN'T HAVE MUCH BUT HE GAVE WHAT HE COULD HIS TIME, HIS STORIES, HIS SMILE. >> HE BORROWED THINGS. MOST PEOPLE DIDN'T SEE BIPOLAR DISORDER, DEPRESSION, SCHIZOPHRENIA. BUT EVEN WHEN ALL OF THAT HE TRIED TO PROTECT US FROM IT. HE SMILED WHEN HE WAS HURTING HE CALLED US WHEN HE WAS INCARCERATED JUST TO SAY HI OR CHECK IN. HIS VOICE WAS COMFORT. HE MADE MISTAKES? YES. >> BUT HE NEVER GAVE UP ON BEING A FATHER. HE NEVER WALKED AWAY FROM US. >> HE STAYED IN OUR LIVES. HE KEPT CALLING, KEPT CARING, KEPT TRYING. HE WAS BRAVE EVEN WHEN HE WAS SCARED AND THOUGH HE CARRIED SO MUCH PAIN HE CARRIED IT QUIETLY BECAUSE HE DIDN'T WANT TO TOUCH US. THAT WAS MY DAD NOT A PERFECT MAN BUT A MAN WHO LOVED HIS CHILDREN AND TRIED EVERY SINGLE DAY TO BE BETTER THAN THEN WHAT THE WORLD TOLD HIM HE WAS. AND THAT WILL ALWAYS MEAN SOMETHING TO ME. >> I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO SHARE A VOICEMAIL I HAD GOT FROM WHEN HE WAS MA'AM AND I JUST WANT TO SAY ONE THING I GUESS ARE WHENEVER YOU CHECK THESE MESSAGES I WANT TO SAY HI. I DON'T I LOVE YOU CHECKING UP ON MY THANK YOU FOR SHOPPING BUDDY. >> EVERYONE WELCOME TO OUR NEXT SPEAKER PLEASE. YEAH. OH SORRY. >> HI. I'M MILANA. ISABELLA. BILL ALLEN. I'M THE YOUNGEST DAUGHTER OF MELVIN BILL ALLEN AROUND LAST YEAR ON JULY 24TH 2020 FOR A FEW DAYS FROM BEFORE MY BIRTHDAY MY DAD SENT ME A LETTER I WAS ABOUT TO TURN 17. >> IT READ HI MILANA. >> HI. I MEANT I'M MISSING YOUR BIRTHDAY AGAIN SO I'M READY THIS LETTER SO I HAVE PROOF OR YOU HAVE PROOFS THAT I DIDN'T FORGET. >> I WANTED TO DO SOMETHING LIKE IN THE LETTER LIKE WRITE YOU A POEM BECAUSE I REMEMBER THAT YOU LIKE LIKE ME MAKING YOU THINGS. I TRIED TO THINK OF ONE AND NOTHING'S COMING OUT RIGHT NOW. MAYBE I'M JUST NOT GOOD AT IT OR I'M NOT TRYING HARD ENOUGH SO I STOPPED TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH THAT. MAYBE LATER I'LL WRITE ONE IN YOUR OTHER BIRTHDAY I DID THINK OF SOMETHING THAT YOU MIGHT LIKE BY CHANCE IF YOU LET ME DO IT. WE'LL TALK DETAILS LATER WHEN I GET OUT BUT I'M TOLD IT MIGHT BE BE SOONER THAN I THOUGHT. HAPPY 17TH BIRTHDAY, MILANA. JUST IN CASE I DON'T GET THE CHANCE TO GREET YOU ON THE DAY I LOVE YOU, DADDY. >> THAT WAS THE LAST BIRTHDAY LETTER THAT I WILL EVER GET FROM HIM. HE BELIEVED HE WAS GETTING OUT SOON HE HAD HOPE HIS PUTTING SOMETHING NOT JUST A GIFT BUT A CHANCE TO FINALLY SHOW UP IN PERSON TO BE MORE THAN A VOICE ON THE PHONE OR WORDS ON A PAPER. HE JUST WANTED TO BE MY DAD AGAIN. NOW MY BIRTHDAY'S COMING UP THIS WEEK. THIS TIME I'M TURNING 18 DON'T DOGWOOD MO MY OLD SOUL HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN HERE FOR WHAT WE BOTH HOPED IT FOR IT THINK ABOUT WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN IF WHAT OLIVIA TAYLOR HAD DONE WELL IT CLAIMED TO DO IF THEY TREATED HIM LIKE SOMEONE FIGHTING FOR HIS KIDS NOT SOMEONE TO CHECK OFF A LIST IF THEY ACTUALLY HELPED HIM HEAL INSTEAD OF LETTING HIM SLIP THROUGH THE CRACKS MAYBE HE'D BE HERE. MAYBE WE'D BE PLANNING SOMETHING TOGETHER FOR OUR BIRTHDAYS. MAYBE I WOULDN'T BE STANDING HERE WITH NOTHING BUT HIS HANDWRITING IN MEMORY OF A PROMISE HE'LL NEVER BE. >> HE WHO NEVER. HELLO. HE NEVER GOT THE CHANCE TO KEEP. HE WANTED TO DO SOMETHING FOR ME WHEN HE GOT OUT HE NEVER GOT THE CHANCE. >> I STILL HAVE THE MAN. THANK YOU FOR SHARING YOUR THOUGHTS. THE BOARD WILL CONVEY THEIR CONDOLENCES TO YOUR FAMILY AT THE CONCLUSION OF THIS MEETING TODAY. >> OKAY. THANK YOU. WELCOME TO OUR NEXT SPEAKER. >> >> GOOD AFTERNOON. FIRST I JUST WANTED TO SAY HOW BRAVE THESE CHILDREN ARE TO SPEAK UP HERE. AND I WANTED TO SUPPORT THEM IN THAT. MY NAME IS DR. DAN CABELLA. I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF COMPTON'S X COALITION, ALSO A PUBLIC HEALTH SCIENTIST AND SCHOLAR AND ALSO A SURVIVOR OF A FATHER WHO DIED WHEN I WAS ABOUT SEVEN YEARS OLD. TWO SIMILAR CONDITIONS THAT WERE HAPPENING AT 111 TAYLOR THAT MOTIVATED ME TO DO THE WORK THAT I DO. >> SO RUTH WILSON GILMORE REMINDS US WHERE LIFE IS PRECIOUS LIFE IS PRECIOUS. THAT'S NOT JUST A MORAL IDEAL. THAT'S A MATERIAL MEASURE OF HOW OUR SYSTEMS OPERATE AND WHO THEY ARE BUILT TO PROTECT OR DISCARD. OVER THE LAST SEVERAL WEEKS WE HAVE HEARD REPEATED COMPLAINTS ABOUT OVERCROWDING, EXPLOITATION AND THE UNSAFE DEHUMANIZING CONDITIONS AT 111 TAYLOR. THESE WARNINGS WERE NOT HYPOTHETICAL. THEY WERE URGENT. AND NOW MELVIN BULLEN IS DEAD. MELVIN WAS A YOUNG 44 YEARS OLD. HE HAD BEEN WORKING TOWARD SOBRIETY. HE HAD SURVIVED INCARCERATION, PSYCHIATRIC CONFINEMENT AND WAS TRYING TO REBUILD HIS FAMILY SO THAT HE DID NOT WANT TO RETURN TO THE TENDERLOIN. BUT HE WAS PLACED AT 111 TAYLOR, A SITE OPERATED BY GEO GROUP, A CORPORATION WITH LONG VIOLENT RECORD OF PROFITING FROM INCARCERATION IN IMMIGRATION DETENTION. WE MAY NOT KNOW YET IF GEO GROUP'S SPECIFIC PROCEDURES DIRECTLY CAUSED MELVIN'S DEATH. BUT WE KNOW THIS HE WAS MADE VULNERABLE BY A SYSTEM THAT TREATS CERTAIN LIVES AS A DISPOSABLE. THE FACT THAT A MAN CAN COME OUT OF PRISON AS BE PLACED IN A CERTAIN ENVIRONMENT AND BE SENT THERE ANYWAY ONLY TO DIE WITHIN DAYS SHOULD MAKE US ALL ASHAMED. AND IT SHOULD ALSO COMPEL US TO ACT. SUBPOENAS ARE A START BUT WE NEED MORE THAN OVERSIGHT. WE NEED DIVESTMENT FROM CARCERAL HOUSING, AN INVESTMENT IN COMMUNITY LED CARE, HOUSING AND HEALING. MELVIN'S LIFE WAS PRECIOUS. LET'S ACT LIKE IT. THANK YOU. >> THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS . WELCOME TO OUR NEXT SPEAKER. >> HELLO. MY NAME IS LEAH MCKEEVER 1186. PLEASE FORGIVE ME IF I CAN'T FINISH THIS. UM, MELVIN DIDN'T EVEN SURVIVE A MONTH THAT WENT 11 TAYLOR. YOUR POLICIES ON MENTAL HEALTH SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER AND PEOPLE IN CRISIS ARE KILLING PEOPLE. AND THEY KILLED MELVIN. THE BOARD AND MAYORS HAVE ONLY BEEN ESCALATING CARCERAL POLICIES. THEY'RE NOT WORKING. IF THEY WERE, MELVIN WOULD BE ALIVE TODAY AND HE SHOULD BE. WE SPEND OUR LIVES WATCHING OUR DEBT CYCLE THROUGH INCARCERATE ATION AND UNTREATED ADDICTION IN THIS CITY. ONE OF HIS CHILDREN SAID HIS DEATH IS NOT AN ISOLATED TRAGEDY BUT PART OF A LARGER PATTERN OF INSTITUTIONAL FAILURE THAT THIS IS THE END OF THE QUOTE THE GEO GROUP PEOPLE RUNNING WANT TO LIVE IN TAYLOR STREET CONTINUE TO HANG UP ON ALVIN'S FAMILY'S CALLS BECAUSE DU GROUP HAS NEVER FACED CONSEQUENCES FOR THEIR CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY. AND IF YOU THINK I'M EXAGGERATING THEY'RE A MAN DYING. A PREVENTABLE DEATH IS A CRIME TO ME. >> TOTALLY UNAWARE I WAS UNAWARE LAST WEEK AT THE BOARD OF APPEALS TRIAL OR WHATEVER YOU CALL IT THAT THE BOARD PRESIDENT WAS APPOINTED BY BIDEN TO BE THE PRINCIPAL LEGAL ADVISOR TO THE DIRECTOR OF IMMIGRATION AND CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT ICE IN 2021. DID THAT INFLUENCE ANY OF THE BOARD'S VOTES? I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY LIVES MUST BE SACRIFICED TO GEO GROUP TO CITY HALL BEFORE THIS STOPS . >> WE DEMAND JUSTICE FOR MELVIN. THANK YOU. >> THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS. WELCOME TO OUR NEXT SPEAKER. >> HELLO SUPERVISORS. FIRST OFF I JUST WANT TO SAY JUSTICE FOR MELVIN AND CONDOLENCES TO THE FAMILY LOST MY FATHER NOT TOO LONG AGO AND I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH BUT JUST KNOW GOD IS WITH YOU AND HE'S GOING TO AID YOU. ON ANOTHER NOTE, MY NAME IS ASEEL THERA. I SERVE AS A MEMBER OF THE SAN FRANCISCO IMMIGRANT RIGHTS COMMISSION AND I'M HERE IN MY PERSONAL CAPACITY AS A PROUD DISTRICT SIX RESIDENT. I ALSO WANTED TO STAND IN SOLIDARITY OF OUR SOUTH ASIAN COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND SUPPORT THE SOUTH ASIAN HERITAGE MONTH RESOLUTION. SOUTH ASIAN AMERICANS HAVE LONG BEEN A VITAL FORCE IN SAN FRANCISCO FROM BUILDING BELOVED SMALL BUSINESSES TO LEADING FIGHTS FOR JUSTICE HOUSING WORKERS RIGHTS AND EDUCATION. THIS COMMUNITY CONTINUES TO BE A BACKBONE OF OUR CITY'S CULTURE AND CIVIC LIFE AND THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS DESERVE MORE THAN JUST RECOGNITION. THEY DESERVE LONG TERM INVESTMENT AND VISIBILITY. AND ON A PERSONAL NOTE, AS SOMEONE WHO GREW UP ON THE TENDERLOIN, ONE OF MY GUILTY PLEASURES SINCE I WAS A LITTLE KID WAS GOING TO JONES AND GARY STREET AND HAVING TO CHOOSE FROM CHUTNEY SHALAMAR OR PAC ONE FOR THEIR DELICIOUS NAAN. IT'S MOMENTS IT'S SMALL MOMENTS LIKE THAT GROWING UP IN THE TIO THAT MADE ME THERE THAT REMINDED ME OF HOW DEEPLY SOUTH ASIAN CULTURE HAS SHAPED THE SAN FRANCISCO I CALL HOME. THANK YOU SUPERVISOR MAHMOOD AND OUR VICE-CHAIR FROM THE IMMIGRANT RIGHTS COMMISSION FOR AUTHORING THIS RESOLUTION FOR MAKING HISTORY. >> THANK YOU. THANK YOU COMMISSIONER SILVEIRA FOR YOUR COMMENTS TODAY. WELCOME TO OUR NEXT SPEAKER. >> GOOD AFTERNOON RESPECTIVE BOARD MEMBERS. MY NAME IS SHAHIN SHEIKH AND I'M A PROUD SOUTH ASIAN AMERICAN MUSLIM DAUGHTER TO IMMIGRANTS AND INDIAN IMMIGRANT PARENTS. SAN FRANCISCO NATIVE AND A LIFELONG PUBLIC SERVANT WITH 28 YEARS MY CAREER STARTED RIGHT HERE IN THE BASEMENT AT ELECTIONS DEPARTMENT. I CURRENTLY SERVE AS A SECURITY OPERATIONS INTELLIGENCE MANAGER AT SFM TODAY. I RISE TODAY IN STRONG SUPPORT OF SUPERVISOR MAHMOUD'S RESOLUTION AND JUST SEEING SOUTH ASIAN AMERICAN HERITAGE MONTH IN SAN FRANCISCO IN ONE SENTENCE GIVES ME GOOSEBUMPS. >> I THANK YOU SUPERVISOR MAHMOOD FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP AND FOR YOUR PROUD REPRESENTATION AS A FIRST MUSLIM AND SOUTH ASIAN AMERICAN . I RAISED THREE BOYS IN SAN FRANCISCO IN SAN FRANCISCO IN SUPERVISOR CHEN'S DISTRICT, AMAZING DISTRICT AND WE HAVE BEEN PART OF PUBLIC SCHOOL FOR 18 YEARS FROM ROOFTOP TO LOCAL HIGH SCHOOL. >> AND WHEN MY KIDS WERE TEASED FOR WEARING CURRY JERSEY BECAUSE THEY WERE INDIAN AND ASKED WHERE WERE THE NON I DECIDED TO DO EXACTLY THAT. I DECIDED TO HOST AND HAND OUT PARTIES AT THEIR SCHOOL AND I MADE SURE THAT WE SERVED NAAN AND CHICKEN TIKKA MASALA TO ALL THE KIDS. >> I SPENT OVER SIX YEARS VOLUNTEERING AT SAN FRANCISCO'S LAMAZE SCHOOL AND WHERE I SERVED ON THE BOARD. I'M ALSO HONORED TO BE FIRST FEMALE COORDINATOR AT AMERICAN SOCIETY ASSOCIATION AND THEN SIT ON CITY HALL IFTAAR AS WELL A COMMITTEE. SO ALL THESE ARE ROOTED DEEPLY ROOTED IN SERVICE AS WELL AS SOUTH ASIAN TRADITIONS. I URGE THE BOARD TO ADOPT THE RESOLUTION AND SHOW THAT SAN FRANCISCO NOT ONLY WELCOMES ITS SOUTH ASIAN COMMUNITIES BUT IT CELEBRATES US. THANK YOU. >> THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS. WELCOME TO OUR NEXT SPEAKER. >> GOOD AFTERNOON SUPERVISORS. MY NAME IS WALTER ASENSIO. I'M A RETIRED SAN FRANCISCO FIREFIGHTER AND CURRENTLY SERVE AS THE PRESIDENT OF THE SAN FRANCISCO FIREFIGHTER AND EMS BEHAVIORAL HEALTH FOUNDATION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. >> I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT IN THE AMENDMENT TO THE ADMINISTRATIVE CODE AT RS 50 MEMBERS TO DONATE TO OUR FOUNDATION TO PAYROLL DEDUCTION . >> YOUR SUPPORT REFLECTS A STRONG COMMITMENT IN PASSING YOUR TIME, SIR. OH, FORGIVE ME BUT THAT ITEM HAS ALREADY BEEN HEARD IN COMMITTEE AND THE PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD HAS EXPIRED. >> OH, I APOLOGIZE. I JUST WANT TO THANK THE BOARD. I DIDN'T I WAS TOLD TO WAIT TILL 69. >> THANK YOU. I APOLOGIZE BUT THANK YOU. THANK YOU KINDLY. THANK YOU FOR COMING HERE TODAY. WELCOME TO OUR NEXT SPEAKER. >> AS A VIEWER, PLEASE THIS ITEM HERE MR. RIGHT. >> YES. BEFORE I EVEN BEGIN YOUR TIME. THAT ITEM IS NOT ELIGIBLE FOR PUBLIC COMMENT OR A COMMENT THAT I WANT TO PUT ON THE RECORD. SO WHEN YOU GET TO IT YOU ALREADY HAVE FACTS COMING FROM THE PUBLIC. >> MR.. MR. RIGHT. PLEASE DON'T TALK ABOUT THAT ITEM. IT IS NOT ELIGIBLE FOR PUBLIC COMMENT THAT HAS BEEN THROUGH COMMITTEE BUT YOU'VE GOT SITUATIONS WHERE YOU COULDN'T FUNDS FOR THE HOMELESS PROGRAMS AND BY THE SAME RESPONSE YOU ALSO TAKEN AWAY FUNDS FOR TEMPORARY HOUSING. THAT'S NOT FAIR. IT SHOWS A TOTAL DISREGARD FOR THE MOST VULNERABLE PEOPLE AND YOU GOT A PATTERN OF DOING IT. FIRST OF ALL, WHERE'S THAT $24 MILLION THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE FOR THE HOMELESS PEOPLE THAT GAVIN NEWSOM NEWSOM THE NUISANCE IS SUPPOSED TO BE OVERSEEING. >> WE NEVER HEARD NOTHING ELSE ABOUT IT WHEN HE WAS PUT IN CHECKED AND CONFRONTED WITH THE FACTS THAT THE PROGRAM IS MISSING $24 MILLION NONE OF YOU NEVER SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THAT. THEN YOU WANT TO TAKE AWAY FROM FUNDS THAT'S TARGETED FOR THE MOST VULNERABLE PEOPLE YOU ALWAYS HARASS AND SHOW A TOTAL DISREGARD FOR THE INTERESTS OF THE MOST VULNERABLE PEOPLE LIVING IN THEIR VANS. AND THERE ARE THESE YOU TELL THEM THEY CAN ONLY PARK FOR THREE HOURS AND THEN THEY HAVE TO MOVE AND DRIVE AROUND AND TRY TO FIND ANOTHER PLACE TO DEPART. >> THAT'S DISGUSTING. YOU KNOW GOODWILL. THEY CAN'T MOVE AROUND AND LIVE LIKE THAT. YOU DON'T FOLLOW YOUR OWN RULES AND REGULATIONS OF THE CHARTER RULE 14 SAYS 15% OF ALL HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES COMES OUT OF THE MAYOR'S OFFICE ON HOUSING IS SUPPOSED TO BE FOR VERY LOW AND LOW INCOME BRACKET PEOPLE AND THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT'S HOMELESS ON THE STREET AND THEN YOU TURN AROUND AND SAID THE REQUIREMENT TO BE A TENANT IN THE BUILDING NOW TO EACH AND EVERY OPPORTUNITY THAT COMES OUT OF THE MAYOR'S OFFICE ON HOUSING HIGHER 80 TO 90% OF THE AM I IN ABOUT MISAPPROPRIATION OF FUNDS. WHAT IS MAYOR GAVIN NEWSOM AND HIS WIFE DOING WRITING A BOOK ON THAT CRITICAL RACE THEORY AND SELLING IT TO THE UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT, GETTING PAID $1.5 MILLION? THAT'S DISGUSTING. THAT'S TOTALLY DISCUSSED. ALL THAT MONEY SHOULD BE CLAWED BACK AND PUT BACK INTO THE HOME IS FINE, THANK YOU. >> MR. RIGHT FOR YOUR COMMENTS. WELCOME TO OUR NEXT SPEAKER. >> GOOD EVENING. MY NAME IS ANTHONY TAPIA AND I STAND BEFORE YOU TO REMIND YOU OF THE PRIVILEGE THAT YOU HAVE TO SERVE AS SUPERVISORS TO A CITY THAT HAS BEEN A REPRESENTATION OF HOPE AND LIBERATION TO THE WORLD. IN AUGUST OF 1966 A RIOT BROKE OUT WHEN POLICE OFFICERS KEPT HARASSING TRANS WOMEN SEEKING REFUGE. THAT SIGHT STARTED A REVOLUTION AND THAT GAVE ME AND MANY OF YOU THE RIGHT TO EXPRESS YOURSELVES AND YOUR MOST AUTHENTIC SELVES. THAT SIGHT IS NOW THAT SIGHT NOW HOUSES A FOR PROFIT PRISON THAT HAS CONTINUED TO INFLICT VIOLENCE ON THOSE WHO SEEK HOPE AND LIBERATION. >> MELVIN SHOULD HAVE HAD HOPED TO SEE HIS CHILDREN ONCE MORE. MELVIN SHOULD HAVE HAD THE CHANCE TO PLAN A BIRTHDAY FOR HIS DAUGHTER. >> WE SEE WE SPEAK BEFORE YOU TO SEEK JUSTICE AND DEMAND THAT YOU STOP BEING ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH THE NEGLIGENCE OF GEO GROUP. >> WE DEMAND ACCOUNTABILITY. WE DEMAND AN END TO THESE INHUMANE CONDITIONS AND WE DEMAND THAT THE CITY TAKE ACTION NOW. WE SAY THEIR NAMES. WE SAY MELVIN PUT THE ONES NAME AND WE WILL NOT STOP UNTIL GEO GROUP IS HELD ACCOUNTABLE. I'VE HAD THE PRIVILEGE AND HONOR OF GROWING UP IN SAN FRANCISCO. MY FAMILY IT'S A FAMILY OF IMMIGRANTS. WE ESCAPED HORRIBLE CONDITIONS AND WE CAME HERE SEEKING A BETTER LIFE. >> MANY PEOPLE I'M SURE YOU ALL HEAR THIS EVERY DAY TALKING TO THE PEOPLE IN YOUR DISTRICTS THAT COME HERE SEEKING A BETTER LIFE. HOW MANY MORE PEOPLE DO WE HAVE TO LOSE? HOW MANY MORE TIMES DO WE HAVE TO WALK ACROSS THE BUILDING WHERE PEOPLE ARE LITERALLY ASKING FOR HELP TO END THEIR NAMES? AND REMEMBER WE ARE HERE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. WE'LL HEAR FROM OUR NEXT SPEAKER. WELCOME. >> THANK YOU. I'M READING THIS COMMENT ON BEHALF OF ANOTHER SOUTH ASIAN MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC SIKA CHAKRABARTI. MY NAME IS SAIKAT CHAKRABARTI. I'M A RESIDENT OF DISTRICT EIGHT AND I'M COMMENTING IN SUPPORT OF THE SOUTH ASIAN AMERICAN HERITAGE MONTH RESOLUTION. THANK YOU. SUPERVISOR MEHMOOD AND VICE-CHAIRMAN TELUS CHAUDHRY. >> MA'AM, CAN I PAUSE YOUR TIME PLEASE? I BELIEVE YOU HAVE ALREADY ADDRESSED THE BOARD DURING GENERAL PUBLIC COMMENT. >> YES I HAVE. IT IS TWO MINUTES PER PERSON ALTHOUGH YOU'RE PROVIDING COMMENTS FROM ANOTHER PERSON. IF YOU'RE WANTING TO SUBMIT THAT LANGUAGE TO US WE'LL PUT IT IN THE MINUTES. BUT E YOUR TWO MINUTES HAS ALREADY EXPIRED. THANK YOU KINDLY. THANK YOU. >> ALL RIGHT, MARK, YOU'RE UP TO FAMOUS CHRISTIANS DIED THIS MONTH. >> JIMMY SWAGGART AND I'M GLAD HE'S DEAD. TELL YOU THE TRUTH, HE BROUGHT A LOT OF HE DRUG GOD'S NAME IN THE MUD, YOU KNOW, AND THEN JOHN MACARTHUR WHO WAS A CHRISTIAN AND HE YOU KNOW, THE EARLY CHRISTIANS COULD RAISE THE DEAD AND HONESTLY IF WE COULD STILL DO THAT, I'D RAISE JOHN BUT I'D LEAVE JIMMY DEAD. AND YOU KNOW, AFTER HE HAD THE I WOULD HAVE WENT IN THERE, YOU KNOW, AND TOLD HIM HEY, YOU NEED TO GET A JOB. >> YOU STEP DOWN, YOU CAN GO TO CHURCH, YOU CAN SING THE SONGS ,YOU CAN PUT MONEY IN THE PLATE BUT IT'S NOT RIGHT. YOU KNOW. AND A LOT OF PEOPLE OVER THE YEARS HAVE BROUGHT UP JIMMY SWAGGART, YOU KNOW, AND YOU ARE SAVED BY GRACE AND IF HE WAS SAVED HE WAS SAVED. BUT I PERSONALLY DON'T THINK HE WAS. NOW LAST TIME I WAS HERE WE TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE 2300 DAYS AND DANIEL CHAPTER EIGHT WHICH IS ACTUALLY 2300 YEARS AND IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THEY CALL A LUNAR A SOLAR LUNAR THING WHERE THEY COME TOGETHER AND DANIEL COULD NOT HAVE KNOWN THIS BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE INSTRUMENTS TO DETERMINE A TRUE SOLAR YEAR AND A TRUE LUNAR MONTH THAT EVERY 2300 YEARS IT COMES TOGETHER SEE. SO AGAIN, SHOWING THAT GOD STARTED THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA THAT 2300 YEARS DID END IN 1776. IT'S AMAZING. IT REALLY IS. AND SO I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HEARD STUART RHODES TODAY ON INFOWARS. THEY TRIED TO RIG THE ELECTION AND THEY GOT CAUGHT AND THERE SHOULD BE VERY SEVERE CONSEQUENCES FOR THAT. YOU KNOW WHEN WE CAUGHT HILLARY CLINTON THEY SAID YOU KNOW WHAT, LET'S NOT LET'S NOT GO TOO FAR HERE. IT'S THE EX-WIFE OF A PRESIDENT. AND I THOUGHT IT WAS SORT OF TERRIBLE THEY LET HER OFF THE HOOK AND ARE VERY HAPPY I DID. BUT IT'S TIME TO START AFTER WHAT THEY DID TO ME AND WHETHER IT'S RIGHT OR WRONG, IT'S TIME TO GO AFTER PEOPLE. OBAMA'S BEEN QUITE DIRECTLY SO PEOPLE SAY OH YOU KNOW GROUPS THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS VERY WELL. >> LET'S HEAR FROM OUR NEXT SPEAKER PLEASE WELCOME. >> I HAVE SOME COPIES FOR MY NAME IS JIM MCAFEE. >> YES WE'LL COME COLLECT THEM FROM YOU ONE FOR EACH MEMBER OF THE BOARD AND THE CLERK. >> I'LL JUST I'LL JUST READ YOU UNTIL THOSE WERE GOES OFF.

MY NAME AND PHONE NUMBER IS ON THIS PAPER. IF YOU WANT TO CALL ME AND FIND OUT MORE ABOUT LAGUNA HONDA, YOU'RE WELCOME TO MY DOMESTIC PARTNERS AND THE CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER IS CURRENTLY HOLDING EVIDENCE OF IT. >> THANK YOU, MR. MCAFEE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS. NEXT SPEAKER, PLEASE. >> HELLO. I AM READING ON BEHALF OF SHAUKAT CHAKRABARTI. HE SAYS MY NAME IS SHAUKAT KABBANI BHARTI I'M A RESIDENT OF DISTRICT EIGHT AND I'M COMMENTING IN SUPPORT OF THE RESOLUTION PROPOSED BY SUPERVISOR MAHMUD AND VICE CHAIR CONTROL IS CHOWDHURY SAN FRANCISCO EVEN AS A YOUNG KID AND TEXAS IS A CITY THAT VALUES ALL THE DIFFERENT THREADS THAT MAKE UP THE QUILT THAT IS AMERICA. >> WE'RE A CITY WHERE WE BELIEVE ANYONE CAN COME HERE AND BE SAN FRANCISCAN WHILE ALSO BEING ASIAN, HISPANIC, BLACK, FILIPINO, VIETNAMESE OR SOUTH ASIAN. AND THAT'S ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT IN A TIME WHERE A COMPETING NARRATIVE OF AMERICA IS BEING PUSHED ON US A NARRATIVE THAT THESE IDENTITIES MAKE US UN-AMERICAN. WELL, THAT NARRATIVE IS ITSELF UN-AMERICAN AND I'M SO PROUD THAT SAN FRANCISCO BY FIGHTING TO INCLUDE MORE AND MORE IN OUR SOCIETY IS BEING MORE AMERICAN THAN OUR PRESIDENT IS TODAY. I'M PROUD THAT WE ARE THE FIRST CITY IN THE NATION TO DECLARE A SOUTH ASIAN AMERICAN HERITAGE MONTH. IT'S AN AFFIRMATION THAT SOUTH ASIANS BELONG IN THIS CITY AND THIS COUNTRY AND WE ARE A PART OF ITS FABRIC. BUT I DO HAVE ONE SMALL RECOMMENDATION AS WE CELEBRATE THIS MONTH AND YEARS AHEAD SOMETIMES WE TEND TO CELEBRATE THE STANDOUTS AND HIGH ACHIEVERS AND WE CELEBRATE SOUTH ASIAN AMERICAN CULTURE AND THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT. I DON'T WANT TO TAKE ANYTHING AWAY FROM THOSE WHO HAVE ACHIEVED SO MUCH BUT I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE WE DON'T ALSO LOSE SIGHT OF THE VERY REAL ISSUES FACING SOUTH ASIAN-AMERICANS TODAY AS WELL. OUR COMMUNITY IS ONE WHERE WEALTH AND INCOME DISPARITY IS HIGHER THAN ALMOST ANY OTHER COMMUNITY IN AMERICA. WE STILL HAVE ISSUES OF CASTE DISCRIMINATION IN THIS COUNTRY I'M SAD TO SAY WHICH WE MUST ROOT OUT DR. AMBEDKAR, THE FATHER OF THE INDIAN CONSTITUTION, TOLD US WE MUST BEGIN BY ACKNOWLEDGING THE INEQUALITY THAT EXISTS AND WORK TO UPLIFT THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN KEPT AT THE BOTTOM. POLITICAL DEMOCRACY CANNOT LAST UNLESS THERE LIES AT THE BASE OF IT SOCIAL DEMOCRACY IN AMERICA FDR SAID THE TEST OF OUR PROGRESS ISN'T WHETHER WE ADD MORE TO THE ABUNDANCE OF THOSE WHO HAVE MUCH. IT'S WHETHER WE PROVIDE ENOUGH FOR THOSE WHO HAVE TOO LITTLE. I HOPE WE TAKE THE SPIRIT OF THESE THINKERS FORWARD WITH US IN THE CITY AND IN OUR SOUTH ASIAN COMMUNITY. >> THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS. >> ALL RIGHT. ARE THERE ANY OTHER MEMBERS BESIDES THIS GENTLEMAN WHO WANT TO ADDRESS THE BOARD DURING GENERAL PUBLIC COMMENT? >> PLEASE DO STEP UP IN LINE. MR. SLEEPER. ALL RIGHT. WELCOME, SIR. PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD AND BOARD MEMBERS. MY NAME IS RICHARD ASKEW PETERSON. I'M HERE TO TALK ON TWO REPORTS THAT HAVE BEEN REPORTED IN THE CHRONICLE AS WELL AS THE EXAMINER AND THIS IS ON THE PLAN TO SAVE MUNI BY USING PARSONS TAXES. NOW THIS IS THE MOST UNFAIR TYPE OF LEGISLATION FOR TAXATION THAT I KNOW THERE ARE OFTEN OTHER TYPES OF TAP TAXES YOU COULD USE JUST A GENERAL PROPERTY TAX THAT WOULD TAX EVERYBODY EVENLY AS MRS. MOSELEY HAS SAID THAT IT'S REALLY UNFAIR. ESSENTIALLY THE CHASE CENTER IS ON ONE PARCEL. IT'S GOING TO BE TAXED TO SAY $100 AND THE HOUSE OUT IN THE AVENUES IS GOING TO BE TAXED AS A $100 PARCEL. TAXES ARE VERY UNFAIR AND THIS IS GOING TO START A WAR BETWEEN THE EAST SIDE AND THE WEST SIDE DOWNTOWN VERSUS THE BURBS. THE WEST SIDE SHOULD NOT BE PAYING FOR WHAT DOWNTOWN WANTS OR WHAT DOWNTOWN CAN GET AWAY WITH. THE MILLENNIAL TOWER IS SITTING ON ONE OR MAYBE 2 TO 2 PARCELS. I'M DIVIDING MY LOT. I'M GOING TO BE HAVING TWO PARCELS. I'LL BE PAYING AS MUCH AS THE MY LITTLE TOWER OR THE SALESFORCE TOWER BILLION DOLLAR PLACES. SO ANYWAY I HOPE THE THE WORKING GROUP IS UNION LEADERS TRANSIT ADVOCATES, CHAMBER OF COMMERCE MEMBERS, CITY SUPERVISORS, TOP STAFF, THE MAYOR'S OFFICE AND WHAT THEY'RE LACKING ARE HOMEOWNERS. >> THANK YOU.
