MADAM CLERK LET'S GO TO ROLL CALL FOR INTRODUCTIONS.
>> FIRST MEMBER TO INTRODUCE NEW BUSINESS IS SUPERVISOR
WALTON. >> THANK YOU MADAM CLERK.
COLLEAGUES TODAY I HAVE A RESOLUTION AND IN MEMORIAM.
>> THE RESOLUTION IS URGING THE CITY TO ESTABLISH A SMALL
BUSINESS RELIEF FUND FOR MERCHANTS WHO WILL BE AFFECTED BY THIS LATEST CREEK BRIDGE REPLACEMENT PROJECT ALONG THE
THIRD STREET BAYVIEW CORRIDOR. >> CONSTRUCTION WILL BEGIN AS EARLY AS JANUARY 2027 AND WILL LAST FOR ABOUT THREE YEARS
AND WILL RESULT IN THE CLOSURE OF THIRD STREET BETWEEN MORAN
STREET AND CARGILL WAY. CUTTING OFF DIRECT ACCESS FOR
RESIDENTS, WORKERS AND CUSTOMERS.
THIS POSES A SERIOUS RISK TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD SMALL BUSINESSES MANY OF WHICH ARE LEGACY IMMIGRANT OWNED
AND BLACK AND BROWN OWNED ESTABLISHMENTS THAT ARE ALREADY
FACED SYSTEMIC BARRIERS TO RECOVERY AND GROWTH.
THE BRIDGE PROJECT IS NECESSARY FOR PUBLIC SAFETY AND CLIMATE
RESILIENCE BUT THE CITY MUST NOT IGNORE THE ECONOMIC HARM
THAT COULD RESULT WITHOUT PROPER SAFEGUARDS IN PLACE.
SMALL BUSINESSES ALONG THEIR THIRD STREET CORRIDOR ARE
ALREADY SOUNDING THE ALARM THAT THIS PROJECT COULD DEVASTATE
THEIR CUSTOMER BASE AND MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO STAY AFLOAT.
THE CITY HAS A RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT THESE MERCHANTS
AND ENSURE THEY ARE NOT LEFT BEHIND.
JUST LIKE HOW WE CREATED RELIEF FUNDS FOR MERCHANTS DOING OTHER
PROJECTS OR DURING THE PANDEMIC A CREATION OF A SMALL BUSINESS
RELIEF FUND DEDICATED TO THOSE IMPACTED BY THIS PROJECT SHOULD
INCLUDE GRANTS, RENT SUPPORT, MARKETING HELP AND TARGETED
OUTREACH. IF WE CAN FIND AND BUILD
CLIMATE RESILIENT INFRASTRUCTURE WE CAN ALSO FUND
RESILIENCE FOR OUR LOCAL ECONOMIES AND WORKING CLASS
NEIGHBORHOODS. I ALSO HAVE AN IN MEMORIAM.
IT IS WITH A HEAVY HEART THAT I JOIN THE POINT OF SERVING THE
PORT OF SAN FRANCISCO AND OUR ENTIRE CITY IN THE MORNING OF
THE SUDDEN DEATH OF BYRON RHETT .
BYRON WAS A DEDICATED PUBLIC SERVANT WHOSE DECADES OF
LEADERSHIP HELPED SHAPE THE SAN FRANCISCO WE KNOW TODAY.
>> FROM HIS EARLY YEARS AT THE SAN FRANCISCO REDEVELOPMENT
AGENCY WHERE HE LED CRITICAL REVITALIZATION EFFORTS AND BABY
HUNTERS POINT TO HIS TRANSFORMATIVE WORK AT THE PORT
OF SAN FRANCISCO. BYRON BROUGHT VISION COMPARE
VISION AND PURPOSE TO EVERYTHING HE TOUCHED. AS PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT DIRECTOR AND LATER AS CHIEF
OPERATING OFFICER, HE WAS THE QUIET FORCE BEHIND SOME OF THE
CITY'S MOST ICONIC PROJECTS. FROM THE REVITALIZATION OF PIER
ONE TO THE CREATION OF CRANE COVE PARK AND THE INNOVATION AT
MISSION ROCK AND PIER 70. >> BUT BYRON WAS MORE THAN A
LEADER. HE WAS A MENTOR, AN ADVOCATE
AND A BUILDER OF COMMUNITY. HE BELIEVED DEEPLY IN EQUITY,
PARTICULARLY IN UPLIFTING THE BAY VIEW.
AND HE LED WITH MORE THAN MOST INTEGRITY AND HEART.
HIS WORK LIVES ON NOT ONLY IN THE PLACES HE HELPED CREATE
BUT IN THE VALUES AND SPIRIT HE INSTILLED IN THOSE AROUND HIM.
SAN FRANCISCO IS BETTER BECAUSE OF BYRON.
I AM GRATEFUL FOR HIS LIFELONG COMMITMENT TO OUR CITY AND I
EXTEND MY DEEPEST CONDOLENCES TO HIS WIFE ANDREA AND THEIR
SONS JUSTIN AND ZANE. MAY HIS MEMORY CONTINUE TO
GUIDE US AS WE BUILD A MORE INCLUSIVE AND CONNECTED SAN
FRANCISCO. >> THE REST I SUBMIT. THANK YOU. SUPERVISOR WALTON.
>> SUPERVISOR CHAN THANK YOU, MADAM CLERK.
COLLEAGUES FIRST I'M INTRODUCING A RESOLUTION
IN SUPPORT OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF BROADCAST EMPLOYEES AND TECHNICIAN LOCAL 51 WHO REPRESENTS KQED UNION
WORKERS AND THEIR EFFORTS TO DEMAND KQED LEADERSHIP TO
REINVEST IN LOCAL TELEVISION PROGRAMING. STOP OUTSOURCING PRODUCTION WORK SUPPORT VALUABLE UNIONIZED
JOBS AND TO ENSURE THAT OUR PUBLIC MEDIA OUTLETS REFLECT
THE NEEDS OF OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES IN THE BAY AREA. KQED HAD ALREADY ELIMINATED ALL OF THEIR LOCAL NEWS PROGRAMING
IN 2023 AND HAS CONTINUED TO OUTSOURCE PRODUCTION WORK TO
NON-UNIONIZED FACILITIES. CONCLUDES RETREAT FROM LOCAL
TELEVISION PRODUCTION IS NOT ONLY A THREAT TO KQED EMPLOYEES
BUT ALSO SETS A DANGEROUS PRECEDENT FOR UNION LABORERS
AND THEIR SHARE VALUES WITH THE COMMUNITY THAT THEY SERVE.
ALSO COLLEAGUES, TODAY I'M INTRODUCING A RESOLUTION
PUTTING SAN FRANCISCO ON THE RECORD TO OPPOSE STATE SENATE
BILL 70 NINE UNLESS AMENDED AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS
AND VARIOUS TENANTS GROUPS TO ATTEMPT TO SECURE AMENDMENTS
FROM THE BILL'S CHIEF SPONSOR SENATOR SCOTT WIENER.
AND YET THEY HAVE NOT BEEN SUCCESSFUL.
SO AS THEIR REPRESENTATIVE AND LOCALLY ELECTED POLICYMAKER
WE MUST STAND UP AND INTERVENE WHEN BAD STATE POLICY IS BEING
RUSHED THROUGH. WE MUST HAVE THIS DISCUSSION
IN PUBLIC NOT BEHIND CLOSED DOOR.
SB 79 WILL UNDO YEARS OF THOUGHTFUL COMMUNITY PLANNING
AND PUT SAN FRANCISCO'S TENANTS AND SMALL BUSINESSES AT RISK OF
DISPLACEMENT WITHOUT ANY PROTECTIONS PARTICULARLY AS WE
ANTICIPATE ADDITIONAL AMENDMENTS THAT WOULD ALSO
INCENTIVIZE THE DEMOLITION OF RENT CONTROL UNITS.
SB 79 PREDECESSOR TO SB 50 WAS REJECTED YEARS AGO FIVE YEARS
AGO BY THIS BOARD SUPERVISORS IN THIS CHAMBER BECAUSE OF ITS
OVERREACH AND ITS POTENTIAL THREATS TO LOW INCOME
AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR IN VULNERABLE TRANSIT
ACCESSIBLE NEIGHBORHOODS ACROSS CITIES IN CALIFORNIA.
NOW I AM CONCERNED THAT SB 79 IS BEING FAST TRACKED WHILE SAN
FRANCISCO IS UNDERTAKING ITS OWN LOCAL CITYWIDE REZONING UP
ZONING THAT SEEKS TO BE COMPLIANCE WITH THE CALIFORNIA
DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT'S
APPROVED HOUSING ELEMENT THAT WE ALL ALREADY ADOPTED
UNANIMOUSLY. SB 79 WOULD COMPLETELY OVERRIDE
THE WORK OF THAT HOUSING ELEMENT TO CREATE PROTECTIONS
FOR PRIORITY EQUITY GEO GEOGRAPHIES PARTICULARLY IN OUR
NEIGHBORHOOD COMMERCIAL CORRIDORS WHERE SMALL
BUSINESSES ARE ALREADY STRUGGLING WITH RENT AND COST
OF DOING BUSINESS. INCREASE WE CAN NOT BY BLINDLY
TRUST THAT TENANTS AND SMALL BUSINESS WILL SOMEHOW MAGICALLY
BE PROTECTED FROM DISPLACEMENT NEIGHBORHOODS LIKE THE RICHMOND
WILL BE MOST AT RISK OF BEING HOLLOWED OUT AS LOTS ARE MERGED
. >> RENTS ARE INCREASE AND BUILDINGS ARE EMPTY OUT TO MAKE THEM MORE ATTRACTIVE TO
REAL ESTATE SPECULATOR ERS. >> THESE PLACES AND IN OUR
NEIGHBORHOODS HAVE NO PROTECTION FROM ANY OF THESE
SPECULATIVE BEHAVIORS. THERE ARE ALSO NO GUARANTEE
THAT ANY HOUSING ESPECIALLY AFFORDABLE HOUSING WILL EVEN BE
BUILT ANY TIME SOON. SOMEHOW OUR OWN LOCAL
ADMINISTRATION WILL REALLY HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT ULTIMATELY
THIS IS NOT A HOUSING BILL. IT IS A DEREGULATION
AND DEVELOPER GIVEAWAY BILL. IT IS NOT ABOUT ACTUALLY
BUILDING HOUSING. IT IS ABOUT MAKING THE LAND
ATTRACTIVE ENOUGH FOR SPECULATOR AND INVESTORS TO BUY
UP TO INCREASE THE PROFITS AT THE FRONT END.
AND LAND IS ALWAYS MORE ATTRACTIVE WITHOUT TENANTS.
AND IN THIS CASE FOR US THE PEOPLE OF SAN FRANCISCO.
FINALLY THE BIGGEST PROBLEM WITH THIS BILL SB 79 IS THE
LACK OF FUNDING FOR AFFORDABILITY.
GOVERNOR GAVIN NEWSOM PUT OUT A BUDGET WITH NO FUNDING FOR
HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS ONLY PUNITIVE MANDATES.
THIS IS MADNESS AND SAN FRANCISCO CANNOT CONTINUE TO
SHOULDER TOO ENTIRE RESPONSIBILITY FOR FUNDING
HOUSING INFRASTRUCTURE AND FREE MARKET.
>> AND WE CAN ALL KNOW HAVE LEARNED FROM YEARS OF HISTORY
IN SAN FRANCISCO WHEN WE TRIED TO BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING.
THAT FREE MARKET HAS NEVER AND WILL NEVER BUILD US ENOUGH
AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR SAN FRANCISCANS AND THE REST I
SUBMIT. >> THANK YOU SUPERVISOR CHAN. SUPERVISOR CHIN SUPERVISOR CHIN .
>> O SUBMIT. THANK YOU.
>> SUPERVISOR DORSEY. THANK YOU, MADAM CLERK. COLLEAGUES WITH APPRECIATION TO SUPERVISOR MELGAR AND HER STAFF
FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS PARTICULARLY MIKE FERA I AM
TODAY INTRODUCING A RESOLUTION THAT URGES BLUE SHIELD OF
CALIFORNIA AND THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA HEALTH SYSTEM TO
RESOLVE THEIR DISPUTE REGARDING REIMBURSEMENT FOR MEDICAL
SERVICES AND TREATMENT. THIS ONGOING CONTRACT DISPUTE
WAS POISED TO DISRUPT HEALTH CARE ACCESS FOR MANY THOUSANDS
OF SAN FRANCISCANS INCLUDING THOUSANDS OF OUR CITY WORKERS
AND RETIREES. IN A MATTER OF JUST A FEW DAYS.
THANKFULLY WE RECEIVED WORD YESTERDAY THAT THE PARTIES EXTENDED THEIR NEGOTIATING DEADLINE FOR 30 DAYS TO AUGUST
9TH AND THAT THEY REMAIN IN NEGOTIATIONS. >> STILL A LARGE SEGMENT OF OUR CITY'S WORKFORCE AND RETIREES
REMAIN UNCERTAIN ABOUT THE PROMISE OF ACCESS TO UCSF
HEALTH PHYSICIANS AND SERVICES THAT THEY RELIED UPON WHEN THEY CHOSE BLUE SHIELD DURING OPEN ENROLLMENT FOR BLUE SHIELD TO
NOW POTENTIALLY ELIMINATE THESE HEALTH CARE OPTIONS.
IN MY IN THE MIDDLE OF A PLAN YEAR IS IN MY VIEW UNFAIR.
AND I WANT TO EXPRESS MY APPRECIATION TO CITY ATTORNEY
DAVID CHU AND HIS OFFICE FOR EXPLORING THE CITY'S LEGAL OPTIONS IN THIS MATTER. I AGAIN WANT TO THANK
SUPERVISOR MELGAR WHO LIKE ME REPRESENTS MUCH OF UCSF
FOOTPRINT IN SAN FRANCISCO FOR COSPONSORING THIS RESOLUTION.
IT IS A RELATIVELY STRAIGHTFORWARD EXPRESSION OF OUR COLLECTIVE HOPE AS A BOARD OF SUPERVISORS THAT WE URGE
UCSF HEALTH AND BLUE SHIELD TO RESOLVE THEIR DISPUTE BY
RENEWING THEIR CONTRACT AND THEREBY PRESERVING THEIR
MEMBERS ABILITY TO ACCESS THE CRUCIAL HEALTH CARE SERVICES
THEY SIGNED UP FOR OR IN THE EVENT THAT NO LONG TERM
SOLUTION BETWEEN BLUE SHIELD AND UCSF HEALTH IS POSSIBLE.
URGING THE PRIOR THE PARTIES TO AT LEAST COMMIT TO PRESERVE
EXISTING SERVICES FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE PLANNED YEAR
AND TO PROVIDE CERTAINTY FOR FUTURE BENEFITS FOR THE 2026
PLAN YEAR IN TIME FOR OPEN ENROLLMENT THIS FALL.
AS YOUR APPOINTEE TO THE SAN FRANCISCO HEALTH SERVICES BOARD I AM WORKING WITH HHS DIRECTOR RAY JIAN AND HIS TEAM AS WELL
AS CITY ATTORNEY CHU AND HIS TEAM TO MONITOR THIS SITUATION.
I KNOW ALL OF US HAVE BEEN HEARING FROM OUR CONSTITUENTS
AS WELL AS FROM OUR CITY WORKERS AND RETIREES ON THIS
MATTER. FOR THE CERTAINTY OF HEALTH
BENEFITS FOR ALL OF THEM AND THEIR FAMILIES, I HOPE I CAN HAVE YOUR SUPPORT ON THIS RESOLUTION AS WELL AND THE REST
I SUBMIT. >> THANK YOU. SUPERVISOR DORSEY SUPERVISOR AND GAUDIO SUBMIT.
THANK YOU. SUPERVISOR HERR FIELDER.
>> THANK YOU, MADAM CLERK. COLLEAGUES I'M INTRODUCING A
RESOLUTION TODAY TO DESIGNATE JULY 12TH AS CHU KANG DAY
IN HONOR OF THE FIFTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE DISTRICT
NINE BLOCK PARTY THAT CELEBRATES THE LIFE AND LEGACY
OF SEAN MONTERROSA. >> AS IT HAS EVERY YEAR SINCE
20 20, SEAN MONTERROSA HAD A BRIGHT, BEAUTIFUL AND LIMITLESS
LIFE AHEAD OF HIM. HE WAS AMBITIOUS, LOVED BY HIS
COMMUNITY, WAS CONSTANTLY LOOKING FOR WAYS TO UPLIFT
YOUTH AND THOSE AROUND HIM AND WAS DEEPLY PROUD OF HIS
ROOTS. >> AS YOU KNOW, HIS LIFE WAS
TAKEN FROM HIM FAR TOO SOON BY A VALLEJO POLICE OFFICER
IN 2020. BUT HIS MEMORY AND LEGACY LIVE ON IN THE COMMUNITY THAT CONTINUES TO ORGANIZE AGAINST
POLICE BRUTALITY AND HIS POWERFUL SISTERS WHO CONTINUE
TO FIGHT FOR JUSTICE NOT ONLY FOR THEIR FAMILY BUT OTHERS
IMPACTED BY POLICE BRUTALITY AND IN THE STRUCTURES, ART
AND PROGRAMS THAT HAVE BEEN CREATED IN HIS MEMORY INCLUDING
THE SHAWN MONTERROSA. >> KNOWLEDGE A COMMUNITY
LIBRARY THAT PROVIDES BILINGUAL BOOKS ABOUT SOCIAL JUSTICE.
A MURAL IN HIS HONOR AT 24TH AND SOUTH VENICE.
AND THE STREET NAMES ON MONTROSE BOULEVARD NEXT TO
HAILEY PARK WHERE HE GREW UP. >> CAN DAY IS NAMED AFTER
SHAWN'S CHILDHOOD NICKNAME. >> IT IS A BLOCK PARTY FULL OF
ART, MUSIC ACTIVITIES AND CONVERSATION ABOUT THE
ISSUES SHAWN CARED ABOUT AND ABOVE ALL ELSE.
IT IS A DAY FOR COMMUNITY HEALING.
SHAWN WAS A YOUNG LEADER WHO WORKED ON SO MANY ISSUES TO MAKE THIS A BETTER WORLD FOR YOUNG PEOPLE.
IT IS WITH THAT SPIRIT THAT THIS RESOLUTION HONORS HIM
AND HIS FAMILY BY DESIGNATING THIS SPECIAL DAY ON ITS FIFTH
ANNIVERSARY AS TWO CAN DAY AND SAN FRANCISCO.
I WANT TO THANK EARLY CO-SPONSORS SUPERVISORS CHEN
MELGAR AND WALTON. AND I ESPECIALLY WANT TO THANK
MICHELLE AND ASHLEY MONTERROSA FOR THEIR TIRELESS WORK TO
HONOR THEIR BROTHER AND BUILD COMMUNITY AROUND HIS BRIGHT LIGHT. >> THE REST I SUBMIT.
THANK YOU. SUPERVISOR FIELDER SUPERVISOR MAHMOOD. >> COLLEAGUES TODAY I AM
INTRODUCING THIS SHARED HOUSING REFORM ACT AN ORDINANCE THAT IS
MEANT TO MODERNIZE THE CITY'S OUTDATED DEFINITION OF FAMILY
IN THE PLANNING CODE TO EXPAND ACCESS TO SHARED HOUSING
AND BRING SAN FRANCISCO INTO COMPLIANCE WITH STATE HOUSING
REGULATIONS. >> SAN FRANCISCO IS A CITY OF
RENTERS AND IN OUR CITY'S PRESENT HOUSING AFFORDABILITY
CRISIS WE MUST DO ALL THAT WE CAN TO SUPPORT HOUSEHOLDS SHARED BETWEEN UNRELATED ROOMMATES.
THESE HOMES ARE A FIRST STEP TO INDEPENDENCE AND A FIRST STEP
TO A LIFE IN SAN FRANCISCO FOR SO MANY.
BUT UNDER CURRENT LAW MANY OF THESE HOUSEHOLDS MAY BE AT RISK
OF ENFORCEMENT ACTION FROM THE PLANNING DEPARTMENT FOR NOT
FITTING UNDER AN OUTDATED DEFINITION OF FAMILY.
SAN FRANCISCO'S ZONING LAWS TRY TO TELL PEOPLE WHO COUNTS AS A
FAMILY. IF WE WANT TO BE A MORE AFFORDABLE CITY WE HAVE TO START BY LEGALIZING THE WAY
REAL SAN FRANCISCANS LIVE. >> UNDER CURRENT LAW,
HOUSEHOLDS OF MORE THAN FIVE UNRELATED TO INDIVIDUALS WHO DO
NOT COOK MEALS TOGETHER MUST MEET GROUP HOUSING STANDARDS
OFTEN MAKING OLDER HOMES WITH HOUSEMATES TECHNICALLY
NON-COMPLIANT. SO TODAY I'M INTRODUCING THE
SHARED HOUSING REFORM ACT WHICH REMEDIES THIS IN SEVERAL WAYS.
ONE IT REPLACES THE TERM FAMILY WITH HOUSEHOLD THROUGHOUT THE
PLANNING CODE. TWO IT REMOVES NUMERIC LIMITS
ON UNRELATED RESIDENTS LIVING TOGETHER.
>> THREE IT ESTABLISHES A NINE LEASE THRESHOLD TO DISTINGUISH
SHARED HOUSEHOLDS FROM INSTITUTIONAL GROUP HOUSING.
>> FOUR IT RECOGNIZES SHARED FINANCIAL RESPONSIBLE BILITY
LIKE RENT AND UTILITIES AS THE DEFINING FEATURE OF A HOUSEHOLD
. AND LASTLY IT ALIGNS LOCAL LAW WITH STATE MANDATES TO TREAT COMMUNITY CARE AND RECOVERY
FACILITIES SERVING SIX OR FEWER INDIVIDUALS AS DWELLING UNITS.
THE PLANNING CODE WAS AMENDED TO LIMIT THE NUMBER OF UNRELATED ROOMMATES THAT COULD LIVE TOGETHER AROUND THE TIME
OF THE 1978 CITY WIDE DOWN ZONING PROCESS OFTEN PREVENTING
BUILDERS AND DEVELOPERS FROM BUILDING SHARED HOUSING
AND CO-OP HOUSING OPTIONS TO AVOID ENFORCEMENT BY THE CITY.
THE CITY'S PLANNING DEPARTMENT HAS TAKEN 14 ENFORCEMENT
ACTIONS SINCE 2020 REVIEWING THE DEFINITION OF FAMILY
AND ITS INCLUSION OF NON-RELATED HOUSEHOLDS WAS AN
EXPLICIT IMPLEMENTATION RECOMMENDATION OF THE HOUSING
ELEMENT TO ENSURE FAIR, INCLUSIVE AND EQUITABLE HOUSING
STANDARDS. >> THIS IS ABOUT FAIRNESS
AND THIS LEGISLATION RECOGNIZING THAT TODAY'S FAMILIES AND CHOSEN FAMILIES COME IN MANY FORMS.
IF IT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR OUR INCLUSIVE VALUES SHOULD BE GOOD ENOUGH FOR OUR ZONING CODE AS WELL.
>> THANKS TO JOSH MASSAD MORE MARK HOGAN AND LISA ZAUNER FOR
BRINGING THIS ISSUE TO MY ATTENTION FROM THE COMMUNITY.
>> THANKS TO HEATHER GOODMAN AND JULIA GORKA NELSON FROM THE
CITY ATTORNEY'S OFFICE RENO COOPER AND JESSICA GUTIERREZ. GARCIA FROM MY OFFICE AND LIZ WATTIE, ERIN STARR, DAN SNYDER
AND AUDREY MALONEY FROM THE PLANNING DEPARTMENT FOR THEIR HELP ON THIS LEGISLATION. LASTLY, THANK YOU TO MY
COLLEAGUE SUPERVISOR SAUDER, CHERYL AND MELGAR FOR THEIR
EARLY CO-SPONSORSHIP. >> THE REST I SUBMIT THANK YOU.
>> SUPERVISOR MARKMAN SUPERVISOR MANDOLIN THANK YOU
MADAM CLERK. >> COLLEAGUES TODAY I AM INTRODUCING AN ORDINANCE TO UPDATE THE ADMINISTRATIVE CODE
SECTIONS GOVERNING THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SHELTER BASED PROGRAM
FUNDS TO ENSURE THAT OUR LAWS REFLECT THE REALITY OF HOW
GENDER BASED VIOLENCE PREVENTION WORK IS BEING DELIVERED IN SAN FRANCISCO. AS PART OF LAST YEAR'S BUDGET
PROCESS IT WAS CONTEMPLATED THAT THE GENDER BASED VIOLENCE
GRANT PORTFOLIO WOULD MOVE FROM THE DEPARTMENT ON THE STATUS OF
WOMEN TO THE MAYOR'S OFFICE OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT. THAT TRANSITION IS NOW WELL
UNDERWAY, MOSTLY CONDUCTING A FULL PROCUREMENT PROCESS
IN LATE 2000 IN LATE 2024 AND EARLY 2025.
THE NEW GRANT AGREEMENTS WITH COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS ARE SET TO BEGIN TODAY, JULY 1ST.
NOTWITHSTANDING THAT TRANSITION ,OUR ADMINISTRATIVE CODE STILL
ASSIGNS OVERSIGHT OF THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SHELTER BASED
PROGRAM FUND TO THE DEPARTMENT ON THE STATUS OF WOMEN.
THIS ORDINANCE CORRECTS THAT OUTDATED PROVISION AND FORMALLY MOVES ADMINISTRATION TO FUND THE MOST.
THE DEPARTMENT NOW CHARGED WITH OVERSEEING THIS WORK.
THE LEGISLATION ALSO ADDRESSES A NUMBER OF OTHER INCONSISTENCIES AND OUTDATED REFERENCES IN THE CODE.
I WANT TO THANK THE DEPARTMENT ON THE STATUS OF WOMEN THE
COUNTY CLERK'S OFFICE, JESSIE MINORITY IN THE CITY ATTORNEY'S
OFFICE AND MELANIE MATHESON AND MY OFFICE FOR THEIR WORK ON
THE LEGISLATION. I VERY MUCH WANT TO THANK BEVERLY UPTON AND AMBERLY CROSS FOR IDENTIFYING SOME OF THE
ISSUES THAT NEEDED TO GET ADDRESSED IN THE LEGISLATION AND FOR REVIEWING AND PROVIDING FEEDBACK AS IT EVOLVED.
AND OF COURSE FOR THEIR ADVOCACY IN SUPPORTING VICTIMS
OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. AND I WANT TO THANK SUPERVISOR
CHERYL FOR HIS CO-SPONSORSHIP AND THE REST I SUBMIT.
>> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT. SUPERVISOR MELGAR SUBMIT.
THANK YOU. SUPERVISOR SADR.
SUBMIT. THANK YOU. SUPERVISOR CHERYL SUBMIT. THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT.
SEEING NO NAMES ON THE ROSTER. THAT CONCLUDES THE INTRODUCTION
OF NEW BUSINESS. >> ALL RIGHT, WE HAVE THREE

OR PERHAPS TWO MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC. IF ANYBODY WOULD LIKE TO PROVIDE THEIR PUBLIC COMMENT
NOW AND GET THEMSELVES OUT OF HERE.

ENOUGH BECAUSE THERE ARE GOING TO BE SOME REPERCUSSIONS AFTER
COMING UP. >> SO MARK MY WORD IF IF IT
DOESN'T HAPPEN, IT'S BECAUSE I MANAGED TO. >> WHAT IT'S YOU UNDERSTAND THE PREDICTION IS PRECISE OTHERWISE
NOT ASK ME HOW I KNOW THAT'S. >> CONGRATULATIONS TO THE
MAYOR TO HAVE ACCEPTED FINALLY TO STOP TAKING DOWN THE 5G
TOWERS EVEN THOUGH HE DOESN'T WANT TO CONFESS ABOUT IT YET
BECAUSE HIS HANDLER MAY BE A BIT PROBLEMATIC FOR THAT.
>> OKAY SO YOU TWO HERE YOU GET TO DO THE JOB.
START DOING WHAT I SAID DON'T BOAST ABOUT IT TOO MUCH.
>> WHAT HAPPENED TO THE WHY NO REFUGEE ON A TREASURE ISLAND
WOULD HAVE BEEN BACK. WHAT ARE YOU DOING THE ONLY OTHER WAY LIFE REFUGEE FOR MAMMALS NOT CEMETERY ON
TREASURE ISLAND. >> CAN CREATE SOME JOBS AS
WELL. AND HE'S GOING TO BE BEAUTIFUL.
SO ACTUALLY CONGRATULATIONS FOR THINKING ABOUT IT ALREADY.

HE'S GOING TO HAPPEN ANYWAY. EXAMPLE TECHNOLOGY HERE IN THE
FUTURE WE'RE GOING TO CREATE NO MORE STREETLIGHTS, NO MORE
TRAFFIC LIGHTS BASED ON EVERYTHING WITH TECHNOLOGY

ALONE. I WOULD LOVE FOR THEM TO STAND UP AND JUST BE SEEN. >> THE WORK THAT WE'VE DONE HAS
BEEN IN COMMUNITY AND REALLY QUICKLY THE WORK THAT WE HAVE
DONE. AS SUPERVISOR WALTON JUST
MENTIONED HAS BEEN IN COMMUNITY AND IT'S ALSO BEEN IN OUR
SCHOOLS. AND WHEN I LEFT CITY HALL AS A
SPECIAL ASSISTANT TO THE TREASURER I WENT OVER TO THE
SAN FRANCISCO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT BECAUSE OF THE WORK THAT I WAS DOING AND THE COMMUNITY TOOK A PRETTY GOOD
PAY CUT. BUT I HAD PRAYED ABOUT IT AND I
KNEW WHAT MY MISSION WAS AND GOD HAD GIVEN ME THAT
MISSION AND THAT PURPOSE. AND THEN I LEFT THE UNIFIED
SCHOOL DISTRICT TO FOCUS ON THE WORK THAT WE WERE DOING IN THE COMMUNITY. SO AGAIN, IT'S BEEN A BLESSING

NEXT CHAPTER AND THE NEXT JOURNEY.
THE NEXT PHASE OF 100% WILL BE IN THAT LEADERSHIP.
SO I FOCUS ON CULTIVATING THE NEXT GROUP OF LEADERS SO THAT

>> APPRECIATE YOUR TIME AND YOUR RECOGNITION TODAY.
THANK YOU IS AND WE'RE STILL WAITING SUPERVISOR DORSEY RIGHT
OKAY LET'S GO TO DISTRICT THREE SUPERVISOR SLAUGHTER RIGHT
THANK YOU PRESIDENT MAN I MEAN YOU KNOW THE CALENDAR MAY SAY
THAT PRIDE IS OVER BUT SINCE WE'RE SAN FRANCISCO WE'RE GOING TO KEEP THINGS GOING A LITTLE LONGER AND TODAY RECOGNIZE
SCOTT TAYLOR, THE OWNER OF THE CINCH SALOON.
SCOTT, WOULD YOU COME JOIN US AT THE PODIUM?
THE CINCH OPENED IN 1974 ON POLK STREET MEANING IT IS ONE
OF THE CITY'S OLDEST GAY BARS AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHY IN THE
PAST FEW YEARS THERE'S BEEN SO MUCH CONCERN AND ANXIETY AS
RUMORS SWIRLED ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THE CENTURY. BUT TO OUR GREAT RELIEF, SCOTT STEPPED IN LAST MONTH AS THE
NEW OWNER AND FROM TALKING TO HIM AND HEARING FROM HIS
PATRONS I KNOW HE'S DOING THIS BECAUSE HE FEELS A
RESPONSIBILITY AND A CALLING TO CARRY THIS INCH FORWARD.
SCOTT BRINGS MORE THAN TWO DECADES OF HOSPITALITY
EXPERIENCE AND HE'S A LONGTIME LOVE IN HISTORY AT THE BENCH HE
FIRST VISITED MORE THAN 20 YEARS AGO AND HE EVEN HAD HIS
FIRST DATE WITH HIS PARTNER AT THE CENTURY TODAY THE SYNCH
MIGHT BE AMONG THE LAST GAY BARS ON POLK STREET, BUT IT REMINDS US OF THE ROLE THAT POLK STREET HAS PLAYED IN OUR
LGBT Q PLUS HISTORY. SOME OF THE MOST PROMINENT GAY
BARS OF THE 1950S AND 60S WERE ON POLK STREET CORNER POCKET JUMPING FROG AND BUSBY'S THE FIRST GAY BUSINESSES
ASSOCIATION IN THE ENTIRE COUNTRY TAVERN GUILD OF SAN FRANCISCO WAS COMPRISED MOSTLY OF POLK STREET MERCHANTS
AND THE FIRST SAN FRANCISCO PRIDE PARADE HAPPENED NOT ON MARKET STREET OR IN THE CASTRO BUT ALONG POLK STREET IN 1972.
I THINK SCOTT SAID IT BEST WHEN HE SAID IN A CITY WHERE SO MANY
LGBTQ PLUS LANDMARKS HAVE DISAPPEARED, PROTECTING THESE
SPACES IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER.
THIS ISN'T JUST A BAR IT'S A LIVING PIECE OF HISTORY.
AND NOW IT IS SECURED FOR THE NEXT GENERATION TO CELEBRATE,
GATHER AND THRIVE. SCOTT I WANT TO APPRECIATE ALL
THE WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING THAT YOU HAVE DONE AND THAT YOU WILL
DO GOING FORWARD. IT IS NOT EASY TO TAKE A LEAP
INTO INTO WHAT YOU'RE DOING INTO OWNING A SMALL BUSINESS
IN SAN FRANCISCO INTO OWNING A BAR AND ESPECIALLY ONE WITH
SUCH HIGH EXPECTATIONS SUCH A TREASURED PLACE IN SO MANY
PEOPLE'S HEARTS. SO THANK YOU FOR DOING THAT.
THANK YOU FOR MAKING SURE THAT THE CENTRAL LIVE ON FOR ANOTHER
GENERATION. AND WITH THAT WOULD LOVE TO HEAR IF YOU WANT TO SHARE ANY WORDS WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH
FOR THE RECOGNITION I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THIS COMING OUT
BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AND ESPECIALLY SUPERVISOR SADR'S OFFICE WE DO WHAT WE CAN TO PRESERVE THESE SPACES FOR

THE LAW AND AND TRIED TO EXPLAIN TO POLITICIANS
AND OTHERS WHO MAY NOT ALWAYS UNDERSTAND WHAT THE LAW

SEVERAL RETIREMENT CELEBRATIONS WHEN KIMI BURTON STARTED WITH

SHATTERED THE MOLD WITH A FEW F-BOMBS IN BETWEEN.
>> SOME 34 YEARS AGO AS SUPERVISOR DORSEY HAS LAID OUT

INCLUDING THE INCREDIBLE 92 YEAR OLD BURTON WHO IS GRACING
OUR PRESENCE TODAY. SHE HAS GIVEN VOICE TO THE

TODAY I HAVE THE DISTINCT PLEASURE OF HONORING MY DEAR FRIENDS AND DINA AND THE SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS CHARLIE
AND CHRISSIE HARB OWNERS OF CHARLIE'S CAFE.
>> PLEASE COME TO THE PODIUM. >> CHARLIE'S CAFE HAS BEEN A
BELOVED FIXTURE IN BERNAL HEIGHTS THAT HAS BEEN
IN OPERATION FOR OVER 24 YEARS. IT'S BEEN A CENTRAL GATHERING
SPOT ON THE PROCEEDINGS PARK SIDE OF BERNAL HEIGHTS SINCE
2001 BEFORE THE CAFE CAME INTO BEING IN 1989, CHRISTIE DROVE
ACROSS THE COUNTRY FROM HER HOMETOWN OF DETROIT TO LIVE
IN SAN FRANCISCO WITH HER BROTHER AND ATTEND CITY
COLLEGE. >> A NATIVE OF PALESTINE,
CHARLIE ATTENDED BETHLEHEM UNIVERSITY AS AN UNDERGRAD AND WENT ON TO GRADUATE SCHOOL FOR ARCHITECTURE IN JERUSALEM
WHEN THE UPRISING OF 1987 BROKE OUT.
THE RESULTING POLITICAL TURMOIL AND DANGEROUS ROAD CLOSURES
AND BLOCKADES FORCED CHARLIE TO LEAVE HIS STUDIES IN JERUSALEM
AND EARN HIS DEGREE IN ARCHITECTURE FROM UC BERKELEY. CHARLIE MET HIS WIFE AND LIFE
PARTNER CHRISSY IN 1991. THEIR TWO WONDERFUL KIDS DALIA
AND JERRY'S GREW UP IN THE CAFE.
IN 2001 CHARLIE BOUGHT A LITTLE CORNER BUSINESS WITH HIS SISTER AIDA, WHO WAS PLANNING TO RUN A CAFE WITH HER HUSBAND SHORTLY
AFTER PURCHASE RATHER THAN PREGNANT WITH HER THIRD CHILD,
DECIDED TO MOVE HER FAMILY TO CANADA AND LEFT THE BUSINESS
IN THE HANDS OF CHRISTY AND CHARLIE WHO ESTABLISHED WHAT WAS WHAT HAS BECOME A REGULAR STOP FOR HUNDREDS OF
NEIGHBORS FROM THROUGHOUT BERNAL AND THE MISSION THESE
NEIGHBORS ALL CALLED CHARLIE AND CHRISSIE.
THEY'RE GOOD FRIENDS BECAUSE ONCE YOU ENTER THEIR DOOR YOU
ARE BROUGHT IMMEDIATELY INTO THEIR ORBIT OF FRIENDSHIP
AND TODAY YOU CAN SEE THAT IN ACTION WITH THE GROUP FROM THE NEIGHBORHOOD THAT HAS COME TO CHEER THEM ON OVER THE YEARS
. >> OVER THE YEARS THEY HAVE AMASSED A BROAD DEDICATED COMMUNITY WHO ADORE THEM, SOME
OF WHOM ARE HERE AND OVER THE YEARS CHARLIE HAS EMPLOYED A
WIDE DIVERSITY OF PEOPLE WHO COME FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD.
THE CURRENT STAFF ARE RARELY CHRISTINA JO SAY AND ALEXI
CONTRIBUTES SO MUCH TO MAKING THE CAFÃ WARM AND WELCOMING ON
ANY GIVEN DAY THEY CAN BE FOUND WORKING BEHIND THE COUNTER, JUGGLING MULTIPLE ORDERS, PREPARING THE FOOD AND ALWAYS
TREATING EACH CUSTOMER WITH A BIG SMILE.
>> WHAT SETS WHAT SETS THIS PLACE APART FROM OTHERS IS THE
SENSE OF FAMILIARITY AND JOY AND COMMUNITY.
WHEN YOU WALK IN THE DOOR. CHARLIE AND CHRISTY HAVE
DEDICATED THEMSELVES TO CREATING A SPACE THAT IS AN
EXPRESSION OF LOVE FOR THE COMMUNITY AND THEY CONTINUE TO
DO THIS DESPITE THE DIFFICULTIES OF KEEPING A SMALL BUSINESS AFLOAT IN SAN FRANCISCO.
>> THROUGH THE YEARS THEY HAVE HOSTED EVENTS THAT ELEVATE
IMPORTANT SOCIAL ISSUES AND PROMOTE ART, POETRY
AND MUSIC. THEY HOST CULTURAL CELEBRATIONS
AND FUNDRAISERS FOR PALESTINE, UKRAINE AND ALL MANNER OF LOCAL
AND GLOBAL ISSUES. DURING THE PANDEMIC THEY OPENED A PARKLET AND HELD OUTDOOR LIVE BLUEGRASS JAMS ON FRIDAY
MORNINGS AND WEEKENDS THAT CONTINUED TO THIS DAY INCLUDING
A THURSDAY NIGHT POP UP AS WELL AS A POP UP ON FRIDAY MORNINGS.
>> WHETHER IT'S HELPING BUILD CONNECTIONS AMONG NEIGHBORS OR
JUST OFFERING A RELAXING PLACE TO HANG OUT AND HAVE A BITE
CHARLIE'S CAFE IS ALWAYS THERE. >> I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU ALL
FOR BEING SUCH A PILLAR IN THE COMMUNITY AND FOR ALL YOU DO
FOR DISTRICT NINE THAT GIVES YOU A RIGHT FIELDER.
>> THANK YOU PRESIDENT AND BOARD MEMBERS.
>> I JUST WANTED TO ANNOUNCE THAT YOU'RE RETIRING TOO SINCE IT LOOKS LIKE EVERYBODY BEFORE US RETIRED.
>> MAYBE WE KEEP UP THE SAME THEME.
>> WE'RE VERY HUMBLED ESPECIALLY WITH THE PREVIOUS
PEOPLE WHO ARE AHEAD OF US. WE FEEL LIKE WE'RE WE'RE JUST
LIVING OUR LIFESTYLE AND WE'RE DOING OUR NORMAL LIFE.
>> IT'S SO I DON'T THINK RUNNING A SMALL BUSINESS
FRANCISCO IS A BUSINESS. I FEEL LIKE IT'S JUST A
CULTURE. IT'S A WAY OF LIFE.
YOU SPEND TEN HOURS A DAY, SEVEN DAYS A WEEK AMONG THESE
PEOPLE. >> WE'RE VERY HONORED TO WHAT
WE DO. CHRISTIANI, 24 YEARS OLD,
WORKED DAY AND NIGHT. >> IN THE BEGINNING IT'S VERY
HARD BUT WE MADE IT HAPPEN. >> I MEAN LIKE I SAID, WE HAVE
A HUGE FAMILY. I MEAN WE HAVE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WE CONSIDER VERY CLOSE FRIENDS AND FEW PEOPLE ARE HERE
BUT EVERYONE MAKES A DIFFERENCE TO US AND MAKE US GET UP AT
6:00 IN THE MORNING AND OPEN UP AND WAIT FOR A SMILE OR SOMEBODY TO COME AND CHECK ON US.
ESPECIALLY IN THE LAST FEW YEARS FOR WHAT'S HAPPENING
IN THE OLD COUNTRY. EVERYBODY COMES IN WE'RE
TALKING ABOUT HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE A DAY COME AND CHECK ON MY MOM AND MY BROTHER AND MY FAMILY.
SO WE FEEL WE'RE PART OF THE CITY.
I'VE BEEN HERE 35 YEARS AND AS AN IMMIGRANT I DON'T FEEL AS AN
IMMIGRANT AT ALL COMPARED TO EVERYBODY AROUND THE CENTER.
CISCO IS VERY SPECIAL. IT'S REALLY I NEVER LEFT IT
PEOPLE. >> AND HOW COME YOU NEVER TRIED SOMEWHERE ELSE LIKE BECAUSE THIS IS HOME NOW.
>> WE THANK YOU. MY EXTENDED FAMILY MY MOM'S
FAMILY CAME HERE IN THE 70S AND MY GREAT UNCLES CAME HERE
IN THE 60S AND THEY NEVER LEFT EITHER. >> I MEAN IT'S A PLACE TO BE COMFORTABLE AS A FOREIGNER JUST
TO MAKE IT HOME. WE REALLY APPRECIATE THIS HONOR
AND WE'RE HUMBLED TO HAVE IT. THANK YOU SO MUCH.
IS IT STILL ON? I JUST WANT TO THANK ALL OF YOU
GUYS FOR BEING HERE AND SUPPORTING US FOR SO MANY
BASED AND THAT'S ANOTHER. >> ALL RIGHT.
AND FINALLY FROM DISTRICT EIGHT, I AM GOING TO INVITE
DEBBIE LEHRMAN TO COME ON UP. >> COLLEAGUES, TODAY IT IS MY
HONOR TO PRESENT A SPECIAL COMMENDATION TO DEBBIE LEHRMAN
WHO EARLIER THIS YEAR RETIRED AFTER MORE THAN TWO DECADES AS
THE DIRECTOR OF THE SAN FRANCISCO HUMAN SERVICES NETWORK AND A 40 YEAR CAREER OF ADVOCACY COMMUNITY ORGANIZING
AND PUBLIC SERVICE. SINCE 2001, DEBBIE LED THE
HUMAN SERVICES NETWORK, A COALITION OF NEARLY 80
NONPROFIT HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICE PROVIDERS THAT SERVE
THOUSANDS OF SAN FRANCISCANS EVERY DAY. UNDER HER DIRECTION, THE NETWORK HAS BECOME ONE OF THE
MOST TRUSTED VOICES FOR THE CITY'S SAFETY NET ADVOCATE FOR
FAIR FUNDING, EFFECTIVE POLICY AND A MORE EQUITABLE PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN GOVERNMENT AND THE NONPROFIT SECTOR.
>> SHE'S GUIDED THE COALITION THROUGH MULTIPLE BUDGET CRISES,
DEFENDED CRITICAL SERVICES FROM CUTS AND HELPED SHAPED THE
VALUES THAT NOW ANCHOR SAN FRANCISCO'S HUMAN SERVICES FUNDING FRAMEWORK. IN EVERY MEETING, EVERY
HEARING, EVERY HALLWAY CONVERSATION AND CITY HALL,
DEBBIE HAS SHOWN UP RELENTLESS PREPARED AND ALWAYS GROUNDED
IN THE NEEDS OF THOSE MOST IMPACTED. >> BEFORE JOINING THE NETWORK, DEBBIE SERVED IN A RANGE OF
LEADERSHIP ROLES THAT REFLECT HER COMMITMENT TO ECONOMIC
JUSTICE AND OPPORTUNITY. FROM PLACING LOW INCOME WORKERS
INTO GOOD UNION CONSTRUCTION JOBS TO MANAGING COALITIONS FOCUSED ON ENVIRONMENTAL AND HEALTH EQUITY, TO RAISING
FUNDS AND BUILDING CAPACITY FOR COUNTLESS LOCAL NONPROFITS.
>> A PROUD ALUM OF M.I.T. AND UC BERKELEY SCHOOL OF LAW
GABEL WAS. DEBBIE BROUGHT RIGOR STRATEGY
AND A SENSE OF PURPOSE TO EVERY ROLE SHE HELD.
SHE'S ALSO BEEN A TIRELESS VOLUNTEER AN ORGANIZER RAISING
MONEY FOR FRONTLINE ORGANIZATIONS, COUNSELING
STUDENTS IN CRISIS AND WORKING THE FLOOR AT SAN FRANCISCO'S
ICONIC MUSIC VENUES FOR DECADES AS A VOLUNTEER USHER
AND SUPERVISOR. THROUGHOUT HER CAREER, DEBBIE
HAS COMBINED SHARP POLICY ANALYSIS WITH GRASSROOTS SENSIBILITY. NEVER LOSING SIGHT OF THE
PEOPLE BEHIND THE PROGRAMS. SHE'S BEEN A STEADY CHAMPION
FOR NONPROFIT WORKERS FOR BETTER CONTRACTING PRACTICES AND FOR A CITY THAT INVESTS IN THE PEOPLE AND ORGANIZATIONS
THAT HOLD OUR SOCIAL FABRIC TOGETHER.
HER IMPACT HAS BEEN FELT IN NEARLY EVERY HUMAN SERVICES BUDGET THE CITY HAS PASSED OVER THE LAST 20 YEARS.
ON BEHALF OF A GRATEFUL CITY, THANK YOU DEBBIE, FOR YOUR
PASSION, YOUR PERSISTENCE, YOUR INCREDIBLE MIND AND YOUR
LIFELONG COMMITMENT TO MAKING SAN FRANCISCO A MORE JUST
AND COMPASSIONATE PLACE. CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR VERY
WELL-EARNED RETIREMENT AND NOW THE FLOOR IS YOURS.
>> THANK YOU, PRESIDENT RANDLEMAN FOR THIS HONOR.
>> IT IS VERY MEANINGFUL TO ME. I WAS VERY NERVOUS THE FIRST
TIME I CAME UP TO THIS PODIUM ALMOST 25 YEARS AGO AND I'M A
LITTLE NERVOUS NOW. >> WELL, DEBBIE, WE WANT TO
HEAR YOU BETTER SO GRAB THAT MICROPHONE CLOSER TO YOU, PLEASE. >> GOT IT. ANGELA, THANK YOU. ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS I DID
FOR THE HUMAN SERVICES NETWORK WAS ORGANIZE A CONFERENCE ON
THIS THE THREE LEGGED STOOL THE PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN NONPROFITS,
GOVERNMENT AND THE PHILANTHROPIC SECTOR. AND TODAY IT FEELS LIKE THAT PARTNERSHIP'S A LITTLE SHAKY.
WE HAVE SOME HUGE BUDGET CUTS POLITICAL ATTACKS COMING FROM
WELL MONEYED INTERESTS AND A FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT IS
MAKING THE ACT OF HELPING PEOPLE ALMOST SUBVERSIVE.
AND IT IS SHOCKING WHAT WE'RE GOING THROUGH TODAY.
>> I WOULD BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T MENTION THE COST OF DOING BUSINESS TODAY. >> I HAVE I'VE USED THAT PHRASE
SO MANY TIMES THAT I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT TRAINING A PARROT TO JUST
SIT ON MY SHOULDER AND SAY IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN UNTIL IT
SINKS IN. >> NONPROFITS ARE A TREASURE.
>> YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S GOT TILL IT'S GONE AND THE CITY
MUST RENEW ITS COMMITMENT TO SUSTAINING OUR NONPROFITS TO
PREVENT UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE THIS AND HARM TO THE PEOPLE
THAT WE SERVE. AND MOST IMPORTANT I THANK
EVERY FRONT LINE WORKER WHO HAS THE HARDEST JOB IN THE CITY
GETTING UP IN THE MORNING AND GOING OUT THERE TO HELP PEOPLE. >> THEY DESERVE BETTER WAGES.
>> I CAN SPEAK PERSONALLY WHAT IT'S LIKE TO HAVE A 45 YEAR
CAREER IN THE NONPROFIT SECTOR. I'VE BEEN ABLE TO GET AWAY WITH
IT BECAUSE I HAVE A RENT CONTROLLED APARTMENT. I HAVE CATS INSTEAD OF KIDS AND YEAH, I HAVE A SECOND JOB.
>> I DO SECURITY AT THE FILLMORE SO I CAN GO SEE LIVE
MUSIC THAT I CAN'T AFFORD ON A NONPROFIT SALARY.
AND IT'S NOT RIGHT TO ASK THAT OF OTHERS WHO WANT TO HAVE A
SIMILAR CAREER PATH. SO WE NEED TO REMAIN LASER
FOCUSED ON THAT GOAL. SAN FRANCISCO HAS ALWAYS BEEN A
LEADER AND HAS ALWAYS AND WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE NATIONAL
CHANGE BY OUR EXAMPLE. AND SO EVERYTHING YOU DO
IN THIS ROOM IS IMPORTANT. IT HAS BEEN MY PRIVILEGE TO BE
A PART OF THAT AS AN ADVOCATE FOR OUR SECTOR AND TO HELP
EMPOWER OTHERS TO FILL THAT ROLE AS WELL.
AND I HAVE THE DEEPEST GRATITUDE TO ALL OF OUR
NONPROFITS. THEIR LEADERS AND THEIR WORKERS
TO THE HUMAN SERVICES NETWORK'S FOUNDERS BRUCE FISHER AND ANNE
LAZARUS WHO HIRED ME 24 YEARS AGO AND TO OUR CO-CHAIRS STEVE
FIELDS AND SHERRILYN ADAMS WHO GIVE SO MUCH OF THEIR TIME TO
HSN WHILE STRUGGLING TO RUN THEIR OWN HUGE ORGANIZATIONS.
AND TO OUR NEW LEADER ROCIO MOLINA WHO IF YOU HAVEN'T MET
HER YET YOU'RE YOU'RE GOING TO AND HAVE EVERY CONFIDENCE
IN HER ABILITY TO TAKE ON THIS NEXT PHASE OF HER SENSE WORK.
I THANK MY PARTNER JOEL GENDLER FOR SUPPORTING ME.
>> I COULDN'T DO THIS WORK WITHOUT HIM AND I THINK EVERY
PUBLIC OFFICIAL DEPARTMENT HEAD SUPERVISOR, MAYOR'S OFFICE
STAFF PERSON, LEGISLATIVE STAFF ANGELA ALL OF YOU WHO HAVE
STOOD UP FOR OUR SECTOR AND WHO HAVE SUPPORTED BETTER FUNDING,
BETTER SERVICES AND BETTER PAY FOR OUR WORKERS AND OVER THE
YEARS EVEN THE ONES WHO EVEN WHEN WE'VE DISAGREED I HAVE TO
SAY THAT MOST HAVE ENGAGED IN CONVERSATIONS WITH RESPECT
AND SUBSTANCE AND THOUGHTFULNESS AND I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT. >> SO AGAIN, THANK YOU
PRESIDENT RANDLEMAN THANK YOU TO THE WHOLE BOARD.
SHOUT OUT TO DISTRICT ONE MY HOME FOR 35 YEARS AND OUR GREAT
SUPERVISOR CONNIE CHAN. >> I'M SURE THIS WILL NOT BE
THE LAST YOU HEAR FROM ME. >> SO THANK YOU

RIGHT HAND SIDE OF THE CHAMBER WILL SET THE TIME FOR TWO
MINUTES. >> LET'S HEAR FROM OUR FIRST SPEAKER. IS THAT YOU, MR. ALLMAN?
>> YEAH. THANK YOU, ANGELA. THE LAST TIME I TALKED TO YOU BOTH AND IN THIS BILL THIS I
THINK I WAS IN THE CLERK'S OFFICE YOU WERE SAYING TOM

THANK YOU, MR. RANDLEMAN. I WANT TO SAY ONE MORE THANK YOU, SUPERVISOR. I GIVE TO THE THE JEFFREY.
>> JEFFREY YOUR TIME IS CONCLUDED. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS AND THANK YOU.
THANK YOU. CAN WE HEAR FROM OUR NEXT SPEAKER PLEASE? SORRY.
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YOU'RE WELCOME. THANK YOU FOR ALL YOUR TIME EVERY ONE OF YOU AND THIS WHOLE
ROOM. >> ALL RIGHT. WELCOME TO OUR NEXT SPEAKER. >> OKAY.
HELLO. MY NAME IS LEAH MCGEEVER AND I
LIVE IN D6. >> DURING THE TRANS MARCH THE MAYOR WAS HECKLED AWAY BECAUSE HE WAS NOT WELCOME THERE AND IT
WASN'T HIS EVENT. ON JUNE 28TH THE GENDER GAY
DISTRICT SUPERVISOR HAD THIS TO SAY TO HIS TRANSPHOBIC
CONSERVATIVE BASE. THIS OBNOXIOUS BEHAVIOR DOESN'T
REPRESENT SAN FRANCISCO'S LGBTQ COMMUNITY AND OUR ALLY
MAYOR DANIEL LAURIE DESERVES BETTER. >> EVERYONE IN THE LGBT COMMUNITY NEEDS TO START
CALLING OUT THIS EMBARRASSING FRINGE THAT'S BADLY HURTING THE
CAUSE OF LGBTQ PLUS PROGRESS FOR ALL OF US.
TO ME THIS LITERALLY SOUNDS LIKE HE'S CALLING FOR PEOPLE TO BULLY US. >> FOR WHAT?
DECORUM. NONE OF YOU REPRESENT THE
TRANSGENDER COMMUNITY YOU SHOULD BE SUPPORTING US BUT
YOU'RE NOT. >> SO SHUT THE UP ABOUT HOW
YOU THINK WE SHOULD BE PROTESTING OUR OPPRESSION, OUR DEHUMANIZATION, OUR DEMONIZATION AND ERASURE FROM
NONE OF YOU GAVE A SINGLE ABOUT THE TRANS FLAG BEING
TAKEN AWAY FROM THE PRIDE FLAG RAISING CEREMONY.
BLACK AND BROWN TRANS WOMEN FOUGHT FOR YOUR GAY RIGHTS.
>> AND ARE YOU GIVING ANY OF YOUR RIGHTS UP VOLUNTARILY
BECAUSE OF DECORUM, DECENCY? Y'ALL HAVE ABANDONED TRANS
CHILDREN AND YOUTH WHICH IS UNCONSCIONABLE.
THERE'S NOT ONE PRESS RELEASE OR STATEMENT ABOUT LIFESAVING
HEALTH CARE BEING TAKEN AWAY FROM CHILDREN IN THIS COUNTRY. TRANS CHILDREN. >> HOW CAN YOU ABANDON THEM
KNOWING BECAUSE YOU THINK YOU KNOW THEM BETTER THAN
YOURSELVES. I MEAN YOU KNOW YOURSELF.
>> JUST OFF UNLESS YOU'RE GOING TO SUPPORT US.
DID I INDEED? THERE IS A DRAG ARTIST THE
LATIN NEXT ONE THAT WAS ABDUCTED LAST WEEK BY ICE.
>> ONE SUPERVISOR ACTUALLY SHOWED UP FOR AN EVENT TO
SUPPORT THAT PERSON. ANOTHER ONE SAID THEY'RE KEEPING TABS ON IT AND EVERYONE ELSE IS SILENT, IS SAFE.
A TRANSGENDER AND IMMIGRANT SANCTUARY CITY ARE NOT. AND YOU'LL BE FUNNY IF THIS MEXICAN STOLE YOUR JOB.
>> OH, LIAM MCGEEVER I'VE HEARD YOU MAKE SIMILAR COMMENTS BUT
BEING MORE ARTICULATE YOU HAVE YOU HAVE A GOOD SPEAKING
ABILITY. >> IF YOU ARE IN MY POSITION
WITH EVERYTHING THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS. >> YOU WOULD UNDERSTAND. >> CAN WE HEAR FROM OUR NEXT
SPEAKER PLEASE? GOOD AFTERNOON.
I WAS BORN AND RAISED IN SAN FRANCISCO. I'M A RENTER AND I'VE LIVED IN MY CURRENT HOME ON THE EDGE
OF NOMI VALLEY IN THE MISSION FOR OVER 20 YEARS.
I LOVE THIS CITY. I'VE ALWAYS BELIEVED IN ITS VALUES BUT RIGHT NOW I FEEL COMPLETELY UNPROTECTED.
WE HEAR A LOT ABOUT TENANT PROTECTIONS IN SAN FRANCISCO
AND RIGHTLY SO. BUT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN SOMEONE
WHO IS NEVER ON THE LEASE NEVER SCREENED AND NEVER APPROVED,
GAINED ACCESS TO A UNIT AND BEGINS TERRORIZING ROOMMATES, THREATENING OTHER TENANTS, HARASSING NEIGHBORS,
DAMAGING PROPERTY AND VIOLATING COURT ORDERS?
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THEIR BEHAVIOR DRIVES OUT LAWFUL
TENANTS AND DESTABILIZES ENTIRE BUILDINGS AND LEAVES NEIGHBORS
TO POLICE THEIR OWN SAFETY? WHAT ABOUT THE SMALL BUSINESS
OWNERS WHO HAVE POURED THEIR LIFE SAVINGS INTO THESE PROPERTIES? THIS ISN'T A ONE TIME INCIDENT.
IN MY CASE THIS INDIVIDUAL HAS DONE THE SAME THING AT AT LEAST
FIVE OTHER PROPERTIES ACROSS SAN FRANCISCO AND I'M SURE THERE ARE OTHERS LIKE HIM BAD ACTORS WHO EXPLOIT GAPS IN OUR
CITY LAWS. NOW IT'S HAPPENING AGAIN.
THIS TIME IN THE FLAT DIRECTLY BELOW ME I'VE GONE TO COURT.
I'VE OBTAINED BOTH A CIVIL HARASSMENT RESTRAINING ORDER
AND A CRIMINAL PROTECTIVE ORDER. I'VE FILED REPORTS. I'VE CALLED 911 BUT THE POLICE
ARE STRETCHED SO THIN THEY OFTEN DON'T RESPOND AT ALL OR
THEY SHOW UP HOURS LATER WHEN THE DANGER HAS PASSED.
EVEN CLEAR VIOLATIONS OF COURT ORDERS ARE TREATED AS OPTIONAL.
THERE IS NO COORDINATED CITY RESPONSE, NO ACCOUNTABILITY, NO
SAFETY NET FOR LONG TIME RESIDENTS LIKE ME WHO ARE BEING
TERRORIZED IN OUR OWN HOMES. I'VE HAD TO MOVE MY DOGS TO
SAFETY. I'M CURRENTLY TAKING TIME OFF
WORK TO PACK UP MY LIFE NOT BECAUSE I WANT TO LEAVE BUT BECAUSE I NO LONGER FEEL SAFE STAYING.
THIS IS A SYSTEMIC FAILURE. THERE ARE NO CITY RESOURCES FOR
MASTER TENANTS OR LONGTIME RESIDENTS TO TURN TO WHEN THINGS GO OFF THE RAILS. AND YET WE'RE THE ONES LEFT
HOLDING THE BAG PAYING LAWYERS ,LOSING WAGES, CALLING 911
MANAGING TRAUMA AND FEARING FOR OUR SAFETY IN OUR OWN HOMES.
THIS IS NOT JUST A PERSONAL CRISIS OR HOUSING.
IT'S A FAILURE OF SERVICE. THANK YOU.
>> THANK YOU FOR SHARING. NEXT SPEAKER PLEASE. YOU HAVE. YOU CAN LEAVE IT ON THE DAIS
THERE AND WE'LL PICK IT UP. THANK YOU SO MUCH.
NEXT SPEAKER PLEASE. YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES.
>> GOOD AFTERNOON, SUPERVISORS. MY NAME IS ANN DRAPER AND I'M
STEPHANIE'S MOTHER. I OWN THE BUILDING SHE LIVES IN AND PAYS RENT FOR. >> I HAVE AN UNLAWFUL DETAINER
PROCEEDING GOING AGAINST THIS INDIVIDUAL.
IT'S A NINE MONTH PROCESS. I WILL SEE IT THROUGH TO THE
END. HE'S ATTEMPTING TO EXTORT ME TO
PAY HIM MONEY TO LEAVE. BUT WHAT HE'S REALLY EXTORTING ME FOR IS THE HARASSMENT OF FIVE WOMEN WHO LIVED IN MY
BUILDING. >> THREE OF THEM ARE GONE. NONE OF THESE WOMEN DESERVE TO BE HARASSED AND THERE'S
SOMETHING YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT. YOU CAN TAKE A LOOK AT WHO IS
SLIPPING THROUGH THE CRACKS. A LOT OF THESE POLICIES
AND RENT ORDINANCES ARE A GOOD THING BUT THERE ARE ALWAYS
PEOPLE THAT CAN EVADE THEM AND AND GET AROUND THEM.
THREE ROOMMATES OF THIS INDIVIDUAL LEFT THE BUILDING
EACH IN A PANIC. AN ACCOUNTING ANALYST, A
PRESCHOOL TEACHER AND A WOMAN THAT TAKES CARE OF DOGS. >> THESE ARE WOMEN THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN SAFE LIVING IN A
UNIT. >> HE REMOVES ALL THE SMOKE
PROTECTORS WHO WON'T LET ME IN. ANYBODY IN THE BUILDING COULD
BE INJURED BY THAT AND AND EVERY WAY SO I LOOK, IT'S A
ROADBLOCK. >> I'M AN ATTORNEY.
I'M 76. I'M IN MY 50TH YEAR OF PRACTICE. I SHOULD BE ABLE TO FIGURE THIS
OUT. >> HALF OF MY PRACTICE IS IN DEPARTMENT 501 THE HOUSING COURT AND REAL PROPERTY
DEPARTMENT. BUT I CAN'T GET ANYTHING DONE
THAT PROTECTS MY TENANTS AND I HAVE A MORAL AND A LEGAL
OBLIGATION AND I WISH YOU WOULD DO SOMETHING.
>> FUND THE POLICE DEPARTMENT FOR THE MISSING 400 OFFICERS.
>> TAKE A LOOK AT WHO'S GETTING BY THESE.
THIS MAN HAS 21 CIVIL ACTIONS AND FIVE MORE UNDER ANOTHER
NAME AND 18 CIVIL RESTRAINING ORDERS.
HOW DOES THAT GET SLIPPING THROUGH THE SYSTEM? I HOPE YOU'LL TAKE A LOOK AT IT.
>> IT WON'T SOLVE MY PROBLEM BUT IT'LL BE SOMEBODY ELSE'S.
THANK YOU. NEXT SPEAKER, PLEASE.
>> GOOD AFTERNOON, SUPERVISORS. MY NAME IS MARK SOLOMON
AND I'VE LIVED IN WHAT WAS TO BECOME THE NATIVE CULTURAL
DISTRICT FOR 35 YEARS IN THE NORTH MISSION. I CO-FOUNDED THE COMMUNITY LAND TRUST, SERVED ON THE MTA
CITIZEN ADVISORY COMMITTEE WROTE THE RESOLUTION THAT LED TO THE HARVEY MILK MEMORIAL BEING PLACED HERE AND WAS A
MEMBER OF THE PLAZA 16 COALITION TEN YEARS AGO AS A
VOLUNTEER. >> OUR NEIGHBORHOOD HAS A HISTORY. MISSION NEIGHBORHOOD CENTER 20
YEARS AGO WAS WELCOMED IN AS A HOMELESS CENTER. IT HAS TURNED THE HUNDRED BLOCK OF CAPP STREET INTO.
W WENT AHEAD AND DECIDED ITSELF AT 15TH AND JULIAN IT HAS
TURNED THAT INTERSECTION INTO. WITH THAT RECORD WE OPPOSED
MISSION CABINS ONCE MISSION CABINS WERE CITED AT 1979
MISSION THE FENTANYL INFLUX HAPPENED AND GUNFIRE RANG OUT.
>> WE WERE CORRECT ON THAT. NONE OF THIS HAPPENED BEFORE
THESE FACILITIES WERE OPEN. SO WHEN WE ADD NEW FACILITIES WE BRING THINGS TO NEIGHBORHOODS.
THE CITY'S SOLUTION TO THIS IS FOR MEDA AND MISSION HOUSING TO DECIDE TO SITE PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING FOR HOMELESS
PEOPLE. ADJACENT TO THE MARSHALL
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT NONPROFIT SALARIES. AT MEDA LOUIS GRANADOS MADE
$666,000 IN 2023. SAM MOSS MADE 300 TO $75,000 AT
MISSION HOUSING. MARTY'S A YIMBY.
THE ZOMBIES ATTACKED MARSHALL PARENTS. THEY ATTACKED NONPROFITS AND THEY ATTACKED RESIDENTS AS
NIMBYS. EVEN AFTER WE FOUGHT FOR
AFFORDABLE HOUSING AT 1979 MISSION BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT ATTICS AND PSYCH CASES TO BE SITED NEXT TO A VULNERABLE
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL THAT HAS A HIGH PREPONDERANCE OF HOMELESS
KIDS, OF IMMIGRANT KIDS OF KIDS OF COLOR AND OF LOW INCOME
KIDS. >> WHAT'S NEXT? AN ICE SUBSTATION IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD TO HELP OUT OUR
PARTNERS. WE'VE ASKED SUPERVISOR FIELDER FOR HELP. SHE'S NOT CONTACTED US.
JACKIE FIELDER, WILL YOU COMMIT RIGHT HERE AND RIGHT NOW TO FACILITATE MEDIATION BETWEEN MARSHALL PARENTS, RESIDENTS
AND NONPROFITS SO WE CAN MEET WITH MISSION HOUSING AND MEDA
TO FIND AN AMICABLE SOLUTION FOR THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR
HOMELESS FAMILIES THAT OUR NEIGHBORHOOD REALLY NEEDS.
>> WILL YOU DO THE CHAIR? SIR, IF YOU COULD ADDRESS THE
WHOLE BOARD THAT'S IN A MUCH NEXT SPEAKER PLACE.
>> YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES. >> MY NAME IS RICHARD PETERSON
. I WELCOME BOARD OF SUPERVISORS
AND PRESIDENT MANDELBAUM AND AND I HAVE TO ECHO A LOT OF
THE POLICIES AGAINST ROOMMATES THAT ARE GOING ON.
OF COURSE ME AS A LAWYER WHEN I WAS ACTUALLY PROACTIVE SAYING
LAW OVER $10,000 TO REMOVE A ROOMMATE THAT WAS ONLY AND WAS
A FRIEND THAT I WAS ONLY CHARGING $400 A MONTH TO LIVE
IN A NOWAY VALLEY BEDROOM APARTMENT WAS NOT APARTMENT
IN MY COTTAGE. >> SO I SYMPATHIZE.
BUT THE MOMENT THE THE MESSAGE FOR TODAY I THINK IS IS
COMPROMISE. WE GOT TO FIGURE OUT SOMETHING
TO COMPROMISE. THERE IS RESISTANCE GOING ON
UNDERSTANDABLE AND YOU HAVE TO HAVE STRONG RESISTANCE TO BE
ABLE TO MAKE A RATIONAL COMP REMISE AND THAT IS THE WORD
THAT I WOULD LIKE TO LEAVE YOU WITH TODAY.
IT'S NOT DEFINED AS IF YOU DEFI CERTAIN THINGS ARE GOING TO
CERTAIN VERY BAD THINGS ARE GOING TO HAPPEN.
>> I'M A I'M AN ATHEIST AND AND I'M CLASSIFIED WITH THE
COMMUNISTS THE SOCIALISTS AND THE TERRORISTS IN THE GROUP
OF FOUR AND SO I CAN SEE THAT IF YOU CAN'T REACH SOME KIND OF
COMPROMISE WHICH I UNDERSTAND OR I DO THINK THAT THE MAYOR IS
TRYING TO DO WE'RE GOING TO BE LOST ANYWAY.
I WANT TO I KEEP WEARING ONE PURPLE FOR A SHOUT OUT FOR THE VALKYRIES AND SHOUT OUT TO MIMI HAAS LOVE YOU.
>> BYE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS. LET'S HEAR FROM OUR NEXT SPEAKER AND GIVE MR. RAHMAN YOU
KNOW THERE'S NO THERE'S NO AUDIBLE SOUNDS OF APPROVAL
AND SUCH AS THAT WHEN IT STARTED JUST BEFORE YOU SPEAK,
SIR, ARE THERE ANY OTHER MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WHO'D
