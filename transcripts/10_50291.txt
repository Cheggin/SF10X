MADAM CLERK COLLEAGUES I AM TODAY ANNOUNCING A LEGISLATIVE
DRAFTING REQUEST TO ESTABLISH THE SAN FRANCISCO HATE CRIME
REWARD FUND WHICH WOULD AUTHORIZE THE CHIEF OF POLICE
IN COORDINATION WITH THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY TO OFFER INFORMANTS A REWARD OF UP TO $100,000 FOR INFORMATION
LEADING TO THE CONVICTION OF A HATE CRIME PERPETRATOR.
THIS PROPOSAL COMES AFTER A SPATE OF HIGH PROFILE INCIDENTS
OVER THE LAST YEAR THAT HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATED AND IN SOME
CASES PROSECUTED AS HATE CRIMES IN SAN FRANCISCO.
EARLY IN MY CAREER I WORKED WITH THEN DISTRICT ATTORNEY
ARLO SMITH TO ESTABLISH THE DA'S HATE CRIMES TASK FORCE
WHICH DEVELOPED POLICIES AND PROTOCOLS FOR PROSECUTING
THESE CRIMES AT A TIME WHEN CALIFORNIA HAD ONLY JUST ENACTED ITS HATE CRIME STATUTE .
MUCH LATER IN MY CAREER I WORKED AS A CIVILIAN MEMBER OF
THE POLICE DEPARTMENT COMMAND STAFF A TWO YEAR STINT DURING
COVID 19 IN WHICH SAN FRANCISCO WITNESSED A SIX FOLD INCREASE
IN HATE CRIMES DIRECTED AGAINST OUR AAPI COMMUNITY.
HATE CRIMES ARE DEFINED BY A BIAS MOTIVATION THAT ENHANCES
THE SERIOUSNESS OF EXISTING CRIMES WHICH CAN RANGE FROM GRAFFITI VANDALISM TO SERIOUS AND EVEN VIOLENT FELONIES UP TO
AND INCLUDING HOMICIDES. SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT
OUR HATE CRIME REWARD FUND OFFER FLEXIBILITY OF UP TO
$100,000 TO ACCOUNT FOR THE WIDE RANGE OF POSSIBLY
APPLICABLE CRIMES. ONE FEATURE OF HATE CRIMES
THAT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE IS THAT IT IS RARELY THE AIM OF
A PERPETRATOR TO VICTIMIZE ANY ONE INDIVIDUAL OR BUSINESS
SOLELY BUT RATHER TO INSTILL FEAR IN ENTIRE COMMUNITIES.
WE HAVE SEEN THAT IN MANY COMMUNITIES HERE IN SAN
FRANCISCO OVER THE LAST YEAR A JEWISH BUSINESS
AND ANTI-SEMITIC ATTACK IN RECENT WEEKS STILL ANOTHER ATTACK ON AN AAPI SENIOR LAST MONTH THREATS AGAINST OUR TRANS
COMMUNITY AND LGBTQ PLUS COMMUNITY MORE GENERALLY AN ANTI-MUSLIM VANDALISM AND HARASSMENT AT LOCAL MOSQUES
LAST YEAR AS A CITY ENRICHED AS OURS IS BY ITS DIVERSITY
AND COMMITTED TO PLURALISM AS SAN FRANCISCO IS, WE SHOULD
LEAD ON THESE ISSUES. IN MY VIEW A GENEROUSLY FUNDED
HATE CRIME REWARD FUND WILL HELP TO FLIP THE SCRIPT ON
LAWLESS BIGOTS BY INSTILLING FEAR INTO HATE CRIMINALS THAT
INFORMANTS WILL BE WELL PAID TO BRING THEM TO JUSTICE FOR THEIR HATEFUL VANDALISM AND VIOLENCE ESPECIALLY IN TIMES LIKE THESE
. IT'S WHY IT'S VITAL THAT WE TAKE THESE ATTACKS SERIOUSLY. THIS REWARD FUND THAT I'M
PROPOSING WILL SEND A STRONG MESSAGE TO WOULD BE HATE
CRIMINALS IN SAN FRANCISCO THAT OUR CITY IS DOING EXACTLY THAT.
I WANT TO THANK COMPTROLLER GREG WAGNER AND HIS OFFICE WITH
WHOM I'M WORKING ON OPTIONS FOR STRUCTURING AND FUNDING THIS FUND. WHICH MAY EXPAND ON SPEEDY'S
EXISTING REWARD FUND WHICH IS RIGHT NOW LIMITED TO HOMICIDE
CASES. IN EITHER CASE IT WOULD BE AN SFPD FUNDED FUND AND THE LEGISLATION WOULD ENSURE THAT
IT'S OPEN TO PHILANTHROPIC SUPPORT. I ALSO WANT TO THANK MY EARLY CO-SPONSORS SUPERVISOR SHERYL
SADR, MAHMUD AND GUARDIAN AND CHEN.
AS ALWAYS, I WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY TO COLLABORATE WITH OTHERS AS THIS LEGISLATION MOVES FORWARD AND THE REST I
SUBMIT. >> THANK YOU SUPERVISOR DORSEY
SUPERVISOR AND GAUDIO SUBMIT THANK YOU.
SUPERVISOR FIELDER SUBMIT. THANK YOU. SUPERVISOR MAHMOOD SUBMIT THANK YOU.
>> SUPERVISOR AMENDMENT I HAVE A BRIEF INTRODUCTION.
>> COLLEAGUES TODAY I AM INTRODUCING LEGISLATION THAT
BUILDS ON OUR CITY'S ALL ELECTRIC NEW CONSTRUCTION ORDINANCE WHICH THE BOARD PASSED IN NOVEMBER OF 2020.
THAT ORDINANCE GENERALLY PROHIBITS NEW CONSTRUCTION
PROJECTS FROM INSTALLING GAS PIPING AND APPLIANCES WITH SPECIFIED EXCEPTIONS. THE LEGISLATION I AM
INTRODUCING TODAY WILL EXPAND THE ALL ELECTRIC ORDINANCE TO
NOW INCLUDE MAJOR RENOVATIONS THAT IS ALTERATIONS
AND ADDITIONS TO EXISTING BUILDINGS THAT INCLUDE SUBSTANTIAL UPGRADES TO MECHANICAL SYSTEMS
AND STRUCTURES. I WANT TO THANK SUPERVISORS MAHMOOD AND FIELDER FOR THEIR EARLY CO-SPONSORSHIP.
AND I WANT TO THANK TYRONE JOO, CHARLES SHEEHAN, CINDY
CRAWFORD, BARRY HOOPER, JOSEPH V.S. NELLIS HER FOR MASSIVE
ENVIRONMENT FOR ALL OF THEIR WORK AS WELL AS ROB COPPOLA FROM THE CITY ATTORNEY'S OFFICE AND CALVIN AND BRAD PHELPS
FROM MY OFFICE. >> AND THE REST I SUBMIT.
THANK YOU MR. PRESIDENT. SUPERVISOR MELGAR SUBMIT THANK
YOU AND SUPERVISOR SARTOR I DO SO LEGISLATION ALONGSIDE
MAYOR LURIE TO ADVANCE THE 530 SANSOM PROJECT A MAJOR DOWNTOWN
DEVELOPMENT THAT WILL BRING COUNTLESS NEIGHBORHOOD
BENEFITS. THIS REPRESENTS THE MOST
AMBITIOUS NEW DEVELOPMENT IN THE NORTHERN PART OF DOWNTOWN IN DECADES. A 41 STOREY TOWER WILL RISE
COMPRISING MIXED USES ACROSS HOTEL OFFICE, RESTAURANT AND WHEAT RETAIL. AND WHEN COMPLETED IT WILL
GENERATE MORE THAN $800 MILLION IN ANNUAL ECONOMIC ACTIVITY.
>> THIS PROJECT MAKES IT CLEAR THAT OUR DOWNTOWN RECOVERY IS
REAL AND QUICKLY ACCELERATING. BUT I'M ALSO EXCITED ABOUT THIS
PROJECT FOR ALL THE NEIGHBORHOOD BENEFITS IT WILL
BRING ABOUT. FIRST IT WILL DELIVER A NEW STATE OF THE ART FIRE STATION 13 TO SUPPORT OUR FIRE
DEPARTMENT AS THEY SERVE PARTS OF CHINATOWN FINANCIAL DISTRICT
EMBARCADERO, BARBARY COAST TELEGRAPH HILL AND JACKSON SQUARE. ADDITIONALLY, THE PROJECT WILL
GENERATE NEARLY $15 MILLION IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE CITY TO SUPPORT THE CREATION OF A 100%
AFFORDABLE SENIOR HOUSING AT 77 TWO PACIFIC AVENUE IN CHINATOWN
OR OTHER DEVELOPMENTS WITHIN DISTRICT THREE.
AND THIS IS MONEY WE WILL SEE QUICKLY WITH AN INITIAL $2
MILLION PAID WITHIN SIX MONTHS OF THE ENTITLEMENT.
AND FINALLY, AS WE FACE REAL FISCAL CHALLENGES, WE SHOULD BE
EXCITED ABOUT THE $14 MILLION IN ANNUAL GENERAL FUND REVENUE
THAT THIS PROJECT WILL CONTRIBUTE. AND THIS SHOULD BE A REMINDER THAT WE CAN MEET OUR BUDGET
CHALLENGES THROUGH GROWTH AS WELL AS THROUGH SAVINGS. >> I ALSO WANT TO RECOGNIZE THE HEAVY LIFTING THAT MY
PREDECESSOR AARON PESKIN DID OVER THE PAST DECADE TO MOVE
THIS PROJECT FORWARD FROM A VISION TO NOW BEING ON THE CUSP
OF GROUNDBREAKING. >> THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS INCLUDING MANY OF MY CURRENT COLLEAGUES ENDORSED THIS
PROJECT IN A RESOLUTION PASSED IN NOVEMBER 2024 WITH AN 11 TO
0 VOTE. THIS PROJECT ALSO HAS WIDESPREAD SUPPORT FROM LABOR WHO RECOGNIZE THE TREMENDOUS
NUMBER OF GOOD PAYING JOBS THAT WILL GO INTO THE CONSTRUCTION
AND MAINTENANCE OF THIS PROJECT. I'M VERY HAPPY TO SEE THIS PROJECT MOVING FORWARD IN MY
DISTRICT. AFTER A PLANNING COMMISSION HEARING IN JULY. I LOOK FORWARD TO THIS
LEGISLATION COMING TO THE BOARD FOR CONSIDERATION LATER IN THE SUMMER. I HOPE IT WILL EARN YOUR
SUPPORT SO THAT WE CAN GET SHOVELS IN THE GROUND.
A NEW FIRE STATION BUILT AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING FUNDS DISTRIBUTED AND THE REST I SUBMIT.
>> THANK YOU. SUPERVISOR SARTOR.
>> MR. PRESIDENT. THANK YOU, MADAM CLERK.
>> LET'S GO TO OUR 2:30 P.M. SPECIAL ORDER RECOGNITION OF COMMENDATIONS. IT'S NOW TIME TO RECOGNIZE
COMMENDATIONS FOR MERITORIOUS SERVICE TO THE CITY AND COUNTY
OF SAN FRANCISCO. >> AND WE WILL START TODAY WITH
DISTRICT TWO SUPERVISOR CHERYL COLLEAGUES.
TODAY IS THE LAST BOARD MEETING OF PRIDE MONTH.
>> AND TODAY I AM SO HONORED TO COMMEND HARRY BRO.
HARRY, WOULD YOU PLEASE COME JOIN US UP HERE?
>> HARRY FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVE NOT HAD THE PLEASURE TO
MEET HIM IS AN EXTRAORDINARY SAN FRANCISCAN WHOSE LIFE HAS
BEEN DEFINED BY RESILIENCE, BY CREATIVITY, BY SERVICE AND MOST
OF ALL BY COMPASSION. HARRY MOVED TO SAN FRANCISCO
IN 1970. >> CURRENTLY LIVES IN CATHEDRAL HILL AND HE IS DISTRICT TWO'S REPRESENTATIVE ON THE
DEPARTMENT OF DISABILITY AND AGING SERVICES ADVISORY
COUNCIL. >> BORN AND RAISED IN A SMALL TOWN OF LOUISIANA QUITE CLOSE TO WHERE MANY OF MY FAMILY
COMES FROM. >> HARRY BROUGHT WITH HIM A
QUIET STRENGTH AND A FIERCE SENSE OF JUSTICE THAT WOULD COME TO DEFINE HIS ROLE IN SAN FRANCISCO'S LGBTQ PLUS
COMMUNITY. AFTER TESTING POSITIVE FOR HIV
IN THE EARLY 1980S DURING THE HARROWING EARLY YEARS OF THE
AIDS EPIDEMIC, HARRY THREW HIMSELF INTO THE VOLUNTEERING
COMMUNITY AS A POWERFUL ADVOCATE AND FRIEND FOR OTHERS
NEGOTIATE NAVIGATING THE LONG ROAD OF SURVIVAL.
>> SINCE THEN HARRY HAS VOLUNTEERED WITH THE SHANTI PROJECT S.F. AIDS FOUNDATION, THE SENIOR IN DISABILITY ACTION
AND MANY MANY MORE HELPING PROVIDE EMOTIONAL AND PRACTICAL
SUPPORT TO OUR DISABLED RESIDENTS AS WELL AS AIDS
SURVIVORS. >> HARRY IS NOT JUST A WITNESS
TO HISTORY BUT HE'S A SHAPER OF IT SHOWING UP FOR HIS COMMUNITY
AS AN ACTIVIST AND AN ARTIST. >> HE IS DEDICATED TO CARRYING
ON THE MEMORY OF THE FRIENDS HE LOST IN THE EPIDEMIC.
SHARING THEIR STORIES TO ENSURE THEY ARE NEVER FORGOTTEN.
AND IF YOU KNOW HARRY, YOU KNOW THAT HE DOES ALL THIS WITH REMARKABLE HUMILITY. MOST RECENTLY HE SPEARHEADED
THE CREATION OF THE LARGE SCALE PRIDE FLAG MURAL AT THE JANE
WARNER PLAZA IN THE CASTRO OF VIBRANT AND LASTING TRIBUTE TO
THE LGBTQ PLUS COMMUNITY'S VISIBILITY AND RESILIENCE.
AS OUR REPRESENTATIVE ON THE DHS ADVISORY COUNCIL, HE
CONTINUES TO LIFT UP THE VOICES OF COMMUNITY MEMBERS WHO ARE TOO OFTEN OVERLOOKED WHETHER IT'S MENTORING OTHERS,
ADVOCATING FOR SERVICES OR MARCHING DOWN MARKET STREET
DRESSED IN FULL ROCKY HORROR FOR PRIDE.
>> HARRY EMBODIES WHAT IT MEANS TO LIVE BOLDLY AND GIVE BACK. HIS STORY REMINDS US THAT PRIDE IS NOT ONLY ABOUT CELEBRATION.
IT'S ABOUT REMEMBRANCE, VISIBILITY AND HONORING THOSE
WHO PAVED THE WAY. >> WE ARE GRATEFUL TODAY AND I
AM ALWAYS GRATEFUL FOR HARRY BRO AND FOR HIS LIFETIME OF
SERVICE. STRENGTH AND SPIRIT AND WE ARE
INCREDIBLY PROUD TO CELEBRATE HIM THIS PRIDE MONTH.
BUT FOR ME PERSONALLY HARRY IS A CONSTANT REMINDER THAT
SUCCESS AND PASSION AND A LIFE OF COMMITMENT TO FRIENDS IS NOT
ALWAYS A LINEAR JOURNEY. >> YOU ARE AN INSPIRING
REMINDER TO ME PERSONALLY THAT SOMETIMES WE MAY FALL
AND SOMETIMES WE MAY DOUBT BUT THAT ONLY GIVES US MORE
STRENGTH. >> AND THAT SUCCESS AND A
BETTER LIFE ONLY COMES THROUGH SOME HARDSHIP AND EVERY DOWN IS
JUST A WEIGHT ON THE STEP TOWARDS MORE UPS.
AND YOU PERSONALLY HAVE INSPIRED ME TO KEEP PUSHING
FORWARD AS I KNOW YOU'VE INSPIRED SO MANY OTHERS.
SO HARRY, I WANT TO THANK YOU QUITE FRANKLY FOR BEING YOU.
I'M SO GRATEFUL TO KNOW YOU JUST A LITTLE BIT THAT I DO.
AND I KNOW THAT MY THANKS IS SHOWN BY SO MANY OTHERS HERE
IN SAN FRANCISCO. HARRY, THANK YOU.
I WANT TO THANK YOU. IT'S A VERY MOVING THING TO BE
HONORED. AND I WANT TO THANK SAN FRANCISCO FOR WHAT IT'S GIVEN ME IN THE LAST 50, 60 YEARS.
AND I ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT WE'RE UNDER WHAT I
CONSIDER TO BE DURESS IN THIS COUNTRY RIGHT NOW FOR THE LGBT
COMMUNITY. AND I WANT TO BE GRATEFUL FOR
ANYTHING THAT THIS BOARD CAN DO TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE LGBT
COMMUNITY IN THIS CITY AND IN THE WORLD BY OUR EXAMPLE.
I'M VERY GRATEFUL. AND I WASN'T PREPARED TO MAKE
ANY SPEECH SO KIND OF FUMBLING .
>> BUT SAN FRANCISCO IS THE BEACON IN THIS COUNTRY FOR
TREATING PEOPLE THE WAY THEY SHOULD BE TREATED, FOR TREATING
EACH OTHER WITH HUMILITY AND COMPASSION.
AND SYMPATHY AND EMPATHY. AND IF WE DON'T CONTINUE TO DO
THAT, THE COUNTRY'S GOING TO SUFFER.
BECAUSE I KNOW FROM THE WAY THAT I PUT THAT MURAL IN JANE
WARNER PLAZA PRIMARILY BECAUSE IT IS ON A WORLDWIDE WEB CAMERA
THAT CAN BE SEEN 24 SEVEN AND DELIVER THE MESSAGE THAT
THE CASTRO AND SAN FRANCISCO IS OPEN TO ALL PEOPLE NO MATTER
WHAT THEIR GENDER OR THEIR NEEDS OR ANY OF THE REST OF IT.
ANYBODY CAN COME TO SAN FRANCISCO AND BE CARED FOR AS A
HUMAN BEING AND TREATED WELL. AND I HOPE THAT THAT CONTINUES
LONG AFTER I'M NO LONGER AROUND WHICH BEING 80 YEARS OLD THERE
IS A LIMIT AND I REALIZE IT SO FOR THE REST OF MY TIME I WILL
BE FIGHTING FOR THOSE PRINCIPLES THAT SAN FRANCISCO
AND THE CITY THAT'S NAMED FOR SAINT FRANCIS WILL ENGENDER.
THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR SUPPORT IN THAT AND YOUR CONTINUED WORK
TOWARD THOSE GOALS. DISTRICT FIVE SUPERVISOR
MAHMOOD CAN WE HAVE MR. MINISTER MARVIN WHITE TO COME
TO THE PODIUM? >> COLLEAGUES TODAY I HAVE THE
PROFOUND HONOR OF RECOGNIZING A VISIONARY ARTIST, A SPIRITUAL
LEADER AND TRUTH TELLER WHOSE WORK HAS RESHAPED HOW WE
UNDERSTAND FAITH JUSTICE AND JOY HERE IN SAN FRANCISCO.
>> WE ARE HERE TO CELEBRATE MINISTER MARVIN K WHITE, THE
MINISTER OF CELEBRATION AT GLIDE MEMORIAL CHURCH WHOSE
MINISTRY IS AS ROOTED IN POETRY AS IT IS IN PROPHETIC POWER
AND WHOSE LEADERSHIP SPEAKS NOT JUST TO THE SOUL OF A
CONGREGATION BUT TO THE SOUL OF OUR CITY.
>> HE'S A PUBLIC THEOLOGIAN, A PREACHER AND A POET WHO BRINGS
PEOPLE TOGETHER ACROSS PERCEIVED BOUNDARIES OF RACE,
SEXUALITY, GENDER, FAITH AND IDENTITY AND INVITES US
INTO A MORE LOVING, LIBERATED AND UNIFIED FUTURE.
>> WHEN I FIRST ASKED AROUND ABOUT MINISTER MARVIN, I
EXPECTED TO HEAR ABOUT HIS WORK AT GLIDE, HIS SERMONS OR HIS
>> BUT WHAT I HEARD MOST CLEARLY OVER AND OVER AGAIN WAS
MORE IMPORTANTLY HOW HE MAKES PEOPLE FEEL.
>> PEOPLE SAID HE GIVES ME PERMISSION TO FEEL JOY AGAIN.
>> HE HELPS US GRIEVE HONESTLY AND CELEBRATE FIERCELY.
>> HE REMINDS US THAT GOD IS NOT DONE WITH US YET WHETHER ON
THE STAGE BEHIND A PULPIT OR HOLDING SPACE FOR HEALING.
MINISTER MARVIN BRINGS PEOPLE INTO A DEEPER RELATIONSHIP WITH
THEMSELVES WITH ONE ANOTHER AND WITH A HIGHER CALLING
TOWARDS JUSTICE MINISTER MARVIN EARNED HIS MASTER OF DIVINITY
FROM THE PULPIT THE PACIFIC SCHOOL OF RELIGION IN BERKELEY.
I WILL NOT HOLD IT AGAINST YOU AS SOMEONE FROM THE OTHER
SCHOOL AND HE'S NEVER STOPPED CREATING SENSE.
HE IS THE AUTHOR OF FOUR BOOKS OF POETRY INCLUDING OUR NAME BE
WITNESS STATUS AND TWO LAMBDA LITERARY AWARD NOMINATED
COLLECTIONS. LAST RITES AND NOTHING UGLY
FLY. >> HIS WORDS HAVE BEEN
PERFORMED ON STAGES ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND ADAPTED FOR SCREEN
AND HE HIMSELF HAS TOURED NATIONALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY
AS A MEMBER OF THE GROUNDBREAKING PERFORMANCE COLLECTIVE POMO AFRO HOMOS ONE OF THE EARLIEST GROUPS
CENTERING BLACK NARRATIVES ONSTAGE.
>> HE HAS LED WRITING WORKSHOPS IN CLASSROOMS, PRISONS
AND CHURCHES. HE IS A CAVE CANHAM FELLOW
AND HE HELPED FOUND TWO VITAL SPACES FOR AND BIPOC WRITERS.
FIRE AND INK AND BIG GLAM. IN 2019 HE WAS NAMED ONE OF THE
WHY BECAME 100 FOR HIS CULTURAL AND COMMUNITY IMPACT BUT HIS
ARTISTRY IS NOT SEPARATE FROM HIS MINISTRY AT GLIDE
AND THROUGHOUT HIS LIFE HE HAS USED STORYTELLING AS SALVATION
AND IMAGINATION AS RESISTANCE. >> WHEN REVEREND CECIL WILLIAMS
SELECTED MINISTER MARVIN TO SERVE GLIDE, HE DIDN'T JUST
CHOOSE A SUCCESSOR. >> HE CHOSE A PATH FORWARD.
>> MINISTER MARVIN LEADS WITH CELEBRATION BUT HE'S NOT AFRAID
OF GRIEF. >> HE LEADS WITH LAUGHTER BUT HE DOES NOT IGNORE PAIN. >> AND ABOVE ALL HE LEADS WITH
LOVE. RADICAL, ALL INCLUSIVE EMBODIED
LOVE IN A WORLD WHERE SO MANY AND TRANS PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TOLD
THAT FAITH DOES NOT BELONG TO THEM.
MINISTER MARTIN MARVIN HAS REWRITTEN THAT SCRIPT.

WHEREVER WE ARE. SO I AM HONORED I AM HONORED TO
LIVE IN A CITY AND IN A PLACE WHERE WHAT YOUR LIFE
EXPERIENCES CAN DETERMINE WHAT YOU CAN GIVE TO THE CITY.
IT DOESN'T EXEMPT YOU OR EXCLUDE YOU FROM ANYTHING. IT IS THE PLACE WHERE YOU START YOUR MINISTRY AND YOUR ACTIVISM
AND YOUR ARTISTRY. >> SO THANK YOU SO MUCH TO MY
FRIENDS AND FAMILIES AND COLLEAGUES AND MY COMMUNITY
AS WELL. I LOVE SERVING AND WORKING
ALONGSIDE YOU ALL. >> THANK YOU AGAIN SUPERVISOR FOR THIS HONOR
. >> DISTRICT SIX SUPERVISOR DORSEY THANK YOU PRESIDENT RANDLEMAN.
COLLEAGUES AS WE CELEBRATE LEADERS FROM OUR LGBTQ PLUS
COMMUNITY FOR PRIDE MONTH IT IS MY DISTINCT HONOR TO RECOGNIZE
JAMES JIM HOSS. >> JIM.
COME ON UP TO THE LECTERN. >> NOW JIM IS A LONG TIME
DISTRICT SIX RESIDENT WHOSE LEGACY ISN'T LIMITED TO THE CAUSE OF LGBTQ PLUS EQUALITY THAT HE HAS CHAMPIONED FOR MORE
THAN 50 YEARS. IN FACT, HIS LEGACY INCLUDES A
CITY THAT IS MORE BEAUTIFUL, MORE WALKABLE, MORE LIVABLE
AND IN EVERY RESPECT TRUER TO ITS RICH HERITAGE AND STORIED
HISTORY THANKS IN LARGE PART TO HIS URBANIST VISION
AND ACTIVISM THAT WAS OFTEN YEARS AHEAD OF HIS TIME. JIM HOSS IS A FIFTH GENERATION SAN FRANCISCAN WHOSE
CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR CITY AND ITS LGBTQ PLUS COMMUNITY
SPANS DECADES. AFTER GRADUATING FROM STANFORD
IN 1964 AND COLUMBIA LAW SCHOOL IN 1969, JIM PRACTICED LAW
UNTIL HIS RETIREMENT IN 2010 SPECIALIZING IN REAL ESTATE
AND LAND USE. BEYOND HIS LEGAL CAREER, HOWEVER, IT IS JIM'S LGBTQ PLUS ADVOCACY AND EXTRAORDINARY
PUBLIC SERVICE WE CELEBRATE TODAY.
>> IN 1983 JIM BEGAN HOSTING MEETINGS IN HIS KITCHEN.
SMALL GATHERINGS THAT WOULD SPARK HISTORIC PROGRESS TOWARD
LGBTQ PLUS INCLUSION. FROM THOSE MEETINGS CAME THE
BAY AREA NONPROFIT NONPARTISAN ALLIANCE SAN FRANCISCO'S FIRST
LGBTQ PLUS POLITICAL ACTION COMMITTEE.
IT WOULD RAISE AND DISTRIBUTE FUNDS TO SUPPORT MANY
CANDIDATES AND CAUSES AND IT WOULD EVENTUALLY BE FOLDED INTO CALIFORNIA'S FIRST STATEWIDE LGBTQ PLUS PAC TO BROADEN ITS
MISSION. JIM HELPED LAY THE FOUNDATION
FOR GENERATIONS OF LGBTQ PLUS POLITICAL ENGAGEMENT
AND REPRESENTATION WORKING AMONG OTHERS WITH THE LATE JIM
RIVALDO WHOM I CONSIDER A FRIEND AND MENTOR.
IN 2004 DURING SAN FRANCISCO'S HISTORIC WINTER OF LOVE.
JIM SERVED AS A VOLUNTEER MARRIAGE COUNSELOR OFFICIATING WEDDINGS FOR 30 COUPLES. IT WAS A MOMENT OF JOY
AND COURAGE IN OUR CITY'S LONG MARCH TOWARD EQUALITY AND JIM
HELPED MAKE IT REAL ONCE CEREMONY AT A TIME.
BUT JIM'S CIVIC IMPACT REACHES FAR BEYOND LGBTQ PLUS ISSUES
ALONE. AT HIS URGING, THEN SUPERVISOR
JACK MOLINARI WITH THE ENDORSEMENT OF THEN SUPERVISOR
HARVEY MILK WHO SAT AT THIS VERY DESK INTRODUCED THE BALLOT
MEASURE IN THE LATE 1970S TO CREATE OUR ELECTED CHARTER
COMMISSION. THAT MEASURE PASSED.
JIM WAS ELECTED A COMMISSIONER AND ALTHOUGH IT TOOK ANOTHER
DECADE AND A HALF THAT COMMISSION'S DRAFT EVENTUALLY BECAME THE BASIS FOR SAN FRANCISCO'S MODERN CITY CHARTER
OF 1996. JIM WOULD GO ON TO CHAIR THE CITIZEN'S TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE IN THE 1980S HELPING
TO PASS TAX MEASURES THAT FUNDED KEY TRANSPORTATION
IMPROVEMENTS AND THAT WOULD CREATE THE SAN FRANCISCO COUNTY
TRANSPORTATION AGENCY. HE ALSO LED THE EMBARCADERO FREEWAY CITIZEN'S COMMITTEE WHICH SUCCESSFULLY BATTLED A
MULTITUDE OF POWERFUL INTERESTS TO FINALLY TEAR DOWN THE
EMBARCADERO FREEWAY A CIVIC EYESORE THAT FOR 30 YEARS
BLOCKED ACCESS TO OUR CHERISHED WATERFRONT AND THAT WAS DAMAGED
IN THE 1989 LOMA PRIETA EARTHQUAKE. NOW TODAY MOST PEOPLE HAVE EITHER FORGOTTEN OR MAYBE NEVER
KNEW HOW HERCULEAN A POLITICAL TASK IT WAS TO REMOVE THAT
FREEWAY. VOTERS HAD SOUNDLY REJECTED A
1986 BALLOT MEASURE BY A 2 TO 1 MARGIN TO TEAR IT DOWN.
AND THAT IT FINALLY HAPPENED IS TESTAMENT TO JIM'S LEADERSHIP AND PERSISTENCE. JIM HAS ALSO BEEN A TIRELESS
ADVOCATE FOR OUR CIVIC CENTER FIGHTING FOR IMPROVEMENTS
THERE. FOR MORE THAN TWO DECADES FROM
SUPPORTING THE CAMPAIGN FOR A NEW MAIN LIBRARY TO HELPING
RESTORE CITY HALL TO ORGANIZING THE MAYOR'S FIRST CIVIC CENTER
STAKEHOLDERS MEETING IN 2019 JIM PUBLISHED THE SAN FRANCISCO
CIVIC CENTER, A DEEPLY RESEARCHED BOOK THAT CAPTURES
THE HISTORY AND MEANING OF ONE OF OUR CITY'S MOST ICONIC
SPACES. IT IS AVAILABLE ON AMAZON AND KINDLE. THIS IS A REQUIRED READING FOR
ANYONE WHO WANTS TO UNDERSTAND THE HISTORIC HEART OF SAN
FRANCISCO AND TO GAIN INSIGHTS FROM THIS AS A BLUEPRINT TO
FULFILL THE PROMISE OF CIVIC CENTER FOR GENERATION TO COME
TODAY. JIM REMAINS A THOUGHTFUL CONTRIBUTOR TO OUR CIVIC CONVERSATIONS AN INFLUENTIAL
URBANIST, A VALUED MEMBER OF THE DISTRICT SIX OFFICERS
UNOFFICIAL BRAIN TRUST AND WHETHER IT'S ADVOCATING FOR
CLEANER STREETS PUBLIC SAFETY OR SIMPLY OFFERING A WELL-TIMED
BIT OF WISDOM. JIM LEADS BY EXAMPLE DURING
PRIDE MONTH AS WE HONOR THOSE WE'VE WHO'VE PAVED THE WAY FOR LGBT Q PLUS RIGHTS AND REPRESENTATION IT IS
ESPECIALLY FITTING THAT WE RECOGNIZE JIM HAS NOT JUST FOR
WHAT HE HAS DONE BUT FOR HOW HE HAS DONE IT WITH INTEGRITY,
WITH PURPOSE AND WITH A LIFELONG COMMITMENT TO THE CITY
HE LOVES AND CALLS HOME. JIM ON BEHALF OF A GRATEFUL
BOARD OF SUPERVISORS, A GRATEFUL LGBTQ PLUS COMMUNITY
AND A GRATEFUL CITY, WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR LIFETIME OF SERVICE AND YOUR EFFECTIVE ADVOCACY ADVOCACY.
>> WE PROUDLY CELEBRATE YOU TODAY.
SUPERVISORS I'M HUMBLED BY SUPERVISOR DORIS IS CHOOSING ME
FOR THIS HONOR. YES, I'VE BEEN AROUND FOR A
LONG TIME AND I HAVE ROOTS TO GO EVEN FURTHER.
I THINK THAT MADE ME FEEL PARTICULARLY OBLIGED TO INVEST
MY SPARE TIME AND ENERGY INTO THE CITY.
>> I DON'T KNOW IF ANY OF YOU REMEMBER. I THINK IT WAS THE KAISER CEMENT COMPANY HAD AN AD THAT
SAID FIND A NEED AND FILL IT. >> AND THAT'S SORT OF WHAT I
DID. I TOOK ON TASKS THAT NEEDED TO
BE DONE OFTEN AND NOBODY ELSE WAS PARTICULARLY INTERESTED
IN THEM. >> AND I GOT INVOLVED.
I HAVE TO SAY THE SUPERVISOR DORSEY THAT MANY OF THESE
PROJECTS I GOT INVOLVED WITH INVITED INVOLVED QUITE A BIT OF
A CONNIVING AND OTHER MISS OR PERHAPS UNDERHANDED TECHNIQUES
TO GET THEM DONE AND BUT THE GOAL WAS TO TO GET THEM GOING.
I GUESS I I'M PROUDEST OF TWO THINGS THE THE WORK FOR THE SAN
FRANCISCO COMMITTEE THE SALES TAX THAT WAS SORT OF A FREE
FLOATING COMMITTEE. MARY AGNES WASN'T PARTICULARLY
INTERESTED IN IT. THE SUPERVISORS HADN'T AT THAT
TIME HAD A LITTLE IDEA OF WHAT IT WAS ALL ABOUT.
AND THERE WAS A PERIOD OF TIME WHEN MARY AGNES WASN'T EVEN
TALKING TO ME. >> BUT WE GOT IT PASSED AND BY
55% THOSE WERE THE DAYS WHEN YOU COULD GET THINGS PASSED BY
55%. >> AND I I'VE NEVER ASKED BUT I
SUSPECT THAT THE SALES TAX AND THE RELATED ACTIVITIES OF
THE SAN FRANCISCO COUNTY TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY HAS GENERATED SEVERAL BILLIONS OF DOLLARS INVESTMENT
IN TRANSPORTATION IN THE CITY. >> AND OF COURSE YOU ALL THE
MEMBERS OF THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS WHO ARE THE
COMMISSIONERS GET TO GO TO MONTHLY MEETINGS AND YOU GET
YOUR $150 STIPEND AS WELL. >> AND THE OTHER THING IS MY
WORK AT CIVIC CENTER FIRST WITH THE LIBRARY AND YOU KNOW,
WRITING THAT BOOK WAS A GREAT ACHIEVEMENT FOR ME.
>> THERE WAS A RUMOR SPREAD BY A WORK COLLEAGUE OF MINE THAT I
COULDN'T WRITE ANYTHING. AND OF COURSE THE BOOK CAME
OUT. IT WAS PUBLISHED BY THE
UNIVERSITY OF NEVADA PRESS. AND I HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE OF
HAVING THE GREAT CALIFORNIA HISTORIAN KEVIN STARR GUIDING
ME AND URGING ME ON TO GET IT DONE.
>> BUT IT IS KIND OF THE TEMPLATE OF WHERE WE ARE AND WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT. AND BECAUSE I FOUND THAT BEFORE
THAT PEOPLE HAD NO IDEA THAT THIS WAS ALL ABOUT AND WHY IT
CAME ABOUT AND WHAT ITS SIGNIFICANCE WAS.
AND I'M NOW 83 AND I'M NOT QUITE DONE YET.
THERE'S MORE THINGS TO DO TO COMPLETE AND IMPROVE CIVIC
CENTER AND I HOPE I HAVE SEVERAL MORE YEARS TO TO SEE
THAT. SO I THANK YOU FOR THIS HONOR AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO REVEAL MY LIFE'S ACTIVITIES IN THE
PUBLIC REALM. BEFORE THE PUBLIC CAN
OKAY. OKAY. OKAY. OKAY.
THANKS. OKAY. TIM, I CARRY THIS FOR YOU. >> DISTRICT NINE SUPERVISOR
FIELDER THANKS, PRESIDENT. >> GENTLEMEN, I'D LIKE TO
WELCOME UP TO THE PODIUM. MALIA SPANIEL AND THE WHOLE
CREW AT MOTHER BAR. >> PLEASE COME BACK.
I AM SO HONORED TO RECOGNIZE MOTHER BARD TODAY.
A LESBIAN AND BAR IN THE HEART OF THE MISSION ON 16TH STREET.
MOTHER IS MORE THAN JUST A BAR. IT'S A SANCTUARY WHERE ALL
IDENTITIES ARE EMBRACED AND CELEBRATED.
>> IT'S A PLACE WHERE WOMEN FIND COMMUNITY JOY
AND BELONGING. BORN FROM A VISION TO FILL A LONGS STANDING GAP IN SAN FRANCISCO'S NIGHTLIFE MOTHER
BAR HAS BECOME A HOME BASE FOR WOMEN AND FEMMES THAT HAVE
LACKED A PLACE THAT CENTERED OUR EXPERIENCES. >> AT THE HEART OF MOTHER IS MALIA ESPANOL.
MALIA HAS BEEN SHAPING SAN FRANCISCO CULTURAL SPACES FOR
YEARS FROM RUNNING BELOVED BARS LIKE PUBS AND THE PARK SIDE TO
OPENING UP HER OWN MUAY THAI GYM. MALIA HAS CREATED SPACES WHERE CONNECTIONS FLOURISH WITH
MOTHER. >> SHE CREATED SOMETHING REALLY
SPECIAL. SHE CREATED A NEIGHBORHOOD BAR
WHERE PEOPLE FEEL SAFE, FEEL SEEN AND FEEL CELEBRATED.
>> MOTHER KEEPS WOMEN'S HISTORY ALIVE WHILST BUILDING
SOMETHING NEW. >> IT STANDS AS A REMINDER THAT
JOY IS VITAL ESPECIALLY RIGHT NOW AND SPACES LIKE THESE ARE
NECESSARY TO OUR SURVIVAL. A MOTHER IS HELPING SHAPE THE
FUTURE OF SAN FRANCISCO WITH EVERY NIGHT IT OPENS ITS DOORS.
IT'S MORE THAN JUST A PLACE TO PARTY.
IT'S A SANCTUARY, A CELEBRATION IN AND A REMINDER OF THE POWER
OF CHOSEN FAMILY. >> TO MALIA AND ALL THE FOLKS
HERE THE ENTIRE MOTHER TEAM. >> I EXTEND MY DEEPEST
GRATITUDE ESPECIALLY AS A WOMAN OF COLOR.
>> THANK YOU FOR CREATING A SPACE THAT FEELS LIKE HOME
WHERE JOY, SELF-EXPRESSION AND COMMUNITY FLOURISH.
YOUR UNWAVERING COMMITMENT TO THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY DOESN'T
JUST INSPIRE. IT UPLIFTS AND EMPOWERS US ALL.
>> AND CONGRATULATIONS ON ALL YOU'VE BUILT AND HAPPY PRIDE.
HERE'S TO SO MANY MORE NIGHTS OF MAGIC MUSIC AND LOVE.
>> HI. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR ALL YOU DO. >> I'M A LITTLE UNPREPARED.
I CAME TO THE CITY 35 YEARS AGO.
>> I SPENT 25 IN THE MISSION DISTRICT.
>> BUT IN THE 90S SORT OF THE COMMUNITY WAS THRIVING.
AND WE HAD SPACES AND EVENTS AND ARTISTS AND YOU KNOW WE HAD
WE HAD SUCH A COMMUNITY. AND I'VE SLOWLY SEEN THAT SORT
OF DISAPPEAR AND COMING OUT OF COVID I LOOKED AROUND FOR
COMMUNITY AND COULD NOT FIND IT. AND SO IN SORT OF A A LOVE LETTER OR AN OFFERING TO THE
COMMUNITY AND TO THE YOUTH OF THE CITY, I THOUGHT IT WAS
IMPORTANT TO OPEN THE BAR AND I FOUND THESE GUYS.
AND YOU KNOW, I CREATE THE BONES AND THEY REALLY ARE THE
LIKE THE HEARTBEAT OF OF THE BAR.
AND THANK YOU SO MUCH AND THANK YOU TO ALL OF YOU GUYS
AND LET'S JUST KEEP ON PROVIDING THE SPACE FOR YOU KNOW, EVERYONE IN THE CITY. >> DISTRICT ONE SUPERVISOR CHAN
THANK YOU PRESIDENT MENDELSOHN COLLEAGUES IT IS TRULY A
PRIVILEGE TO BE ABLE TO INVITE AND RECOGNIZE MALENA LIM A
CELEBRATING A CELEBRATED FILMMAKER, PRODUCER, DIRECTOR,
ADJUNCT PROFESSOR AND LONG TIME LGBTQ ACTIVIST WHOSE FILMS HAVE
BEEN SCREENED AT SOLD OUT THEATERS AT FILM FESTIVAL FROM
ACROSS THE WORLD. HER WORK HAS BEEN EMBELLISHED WITH NUMEROUS PROCEDURES AND HIGHLY COMPETITIVE AWARDS
THAT IS TOO MANY TO NAME. HER WORK HAS ALSO BEEN FEATURED
AT PROMINENT LOCAL INSTITUTIONS INCLUDING DE YOUNG AND ASIAN
ART MUSEUM AND BROADCASTED TO MILLIONS OF AUDIENCE ON PBS.
MADELINE'S ACTIVISM STARTED IN HER EARLY 20S.
SHE RAN AN UNDERGROUND LESBIAN FEMINIST NEWSLETTER
IN SINGAPORE FOR TWO YEARS AND LATER BECAME ACTIVELY
INVOLVED IN THE ASSOCIATION OF WOMEN FOR ACTION AND RESEARCH,
AN ORGANIZATION THAT ADVOCATES FOR GENDER EQUALITY
AND PROVIDES CRITICAL SUPPORT SERVICES FOR WOMEN
IN SINGAPORE. IN 1987 MADELINE CO-WROTE
AND DIRECTED A SKIT CALLED THE MYTH PAGEANT BEAUTY CONTEST A
PARODY ON THE MISS PAGEANT BEAUTY CONTEST IN CELEBRATION
OF INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY. SHORTLY AFTER THE EVENT, HER
COAUTHOR WAS ARRESTED BY THE SINGAPORE GOVERNMENT.
MADELINE ESCAPED PERSECUTION AND EVENTUALLY MADE HER WAY TO
SAN FRANCISCO. TEN YEARS LATER SHE CREATED THE
AWARD WINNING DOCUMENT FREE SAMBA BALAKIAN IN SAN FRANCISCO
IN 1997 A FILM THAT IS STILL BANNED IN SINGAPORE FOR ITS
EXPLORATION OF RACE, SEXUALITY AND NATIONALITY CONTINUING TO
SEE A LACK OF PROPER REPRESENTATION FOR WOMEN OF
COLOR EVEN IN SAN FRANCISCO. SHE CO-FOUNDED CAREER WOMEN OF
COLOR MEDIA ARTS PROJECT CRACK MAP, A LOCAL ORGANIZATION THAT
SUPPORTS THE CREATION AND DISTRIBUTION OF FILMS THAT
ADDRESS CURRENT SOCIAL ISSUE AFFECTING LGBTQ PLUS WOMEN OF
COLOR AND THEIR COMMUNITIES. WOMEN OF COLOR MEDIA ARTS
PROJECT THAT PROVIDES TRAINING, SCREENING OPPORTUNITIES
AND RESOURCE TO FILMMAKERS SO THEY CAN AUTHENTICALLY REFLECT
THEIR LIFE STORIES AND BUILD COMMUNITY THROUGH ART
AND ACTIVISM PARTICULARLY DURING THIS TIME WHEN SO MANY
OF OUR IMMIGRANT AND OUR OUTPUT PLUS COMMUNITY MEMBERS ARE
UNDER ATTACK BY OUR OWN FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.
I KNOW THAT SAN FRANCISCO MUST CONTINUE TO AMPLIFY AND MAKE
SPACE FOR CAREER WOMEN OF COLOR TO TELL THEIR STORIES.
AND I AM JUST SO PROUD AND AND THAT WE GET A CHANCE TO INVITE
HER TO BE HERE BUT TO ALSO SAY THAT I THINK OFTENTIMES A WOMAN
OF COLOR IS DEFINITELY IN ASIA OR REALLY CONTINUE TO BE NOT
ONLY MARGINALIZED BUT ALSO CRIMINALIZED ON SO MANY LEVEL
THROUGH SO MANY LAYERS AND THEIR STORIES ARE NOT TOLD
AND OFTENTIMES THEY'RE LEFT BEHIND. BUT TO HAVE SOMEONE LIKE MADELINE LIM AND WILLING TO
TELL THEIR STORIES AND UNDERSTAND THE RISK TO TAKE
THAT THEY MUST TAKE AND THE FILMMAKERS THEMSELVES AS WELL
AND JUST TO BE ABLE TO CREATE A SAFE SPACE FOR THEM TO TELL
THAT STORIES IS JUST AMAZING. AND FOR THAT I'M JUST SO
GRATEFUL NOT JUST FOR THE WOMEN OF COLOR RIGHT NOW BUT
REALLY FOR THE GENERATIONS TO COME SO THAT THEY HOPEFULLY ONE
DAY MAYBE TAKE THIS FOR GRANTED TO BE ABLE TO SAY YES, THIS IS
A SAFE SPACE AND THIS IS THEIR ROLE AND THAT THEY CAN BE
PROUDLY TO BE WHO THEY ARE NOT JUST IN UNITED STATES OR SAN
FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA BUT ALL AROUND THE GLOBE.
>> AND SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONTRIBUTION.
>> GOOD AFTERNOON, EVERYONE. THANK YOU SO MUCH TO ALL OF THE
SUPERVISORS. PRESIDENT MENDEL MIN
AND ESPECIALLY CONNIE CHEN FOR THIS RECOGNITION. I AM DEEPLY HUMBLED AND TOUCHED IN THE 70S I WAS A TEEN COMING
OF AGE AND I WAS PULLED OUT OF MY CLASSES BY THE SCHOOL
PRINCIPAL BEING COUNSELED TO BE STRAIGHT, GET A BOYFRIEND, PUT
ON MAKEUP. I ALMOST DID NOT SURVIVE MY
COMING OUT. >> AND AS SUPERVISOR CONNIE
CHEN MENTIONED I ESCAPED SINGAPORE BECAUSE I WAS DOING
UNDERGROUND LGBTQ ORGANIZING AND IT WAS GETTING DANGEROUS.
I WAS IN MY EARLY 20S AND I DID NOT YOU KNOW WHO WANTS TO WHO
ENVISIONS HANGING OUT IN JAIL, RIGHT?
I DID NOT. AND I CAME TO SAN FRANCISCO.
IT WAS MY SANCTUARY. SAN FRANCISCO IS A BEACON FOR
SO MANY FOR THOSE OF US WHO ARE LGBTQ.
THOSE OF US WHO ARE IMMIGRANTS AND ARTISTS IT'S FILMMAKING
KICKED MY BUT IT WAS MY CALLING.
I THINK I KNEW I WAS A FILMMAKER WHEN I WAS DEEPLY
ENGAGED IN AN ARGUMENT. >> I WAS 15.
MY GIRLFRIEND WAS A YEAR YOUNGER AND YOU KNOW THOSE
ARGUMENTS AT THAT AGE ARE LIFE AND DEATH LITERALLY.
>> AND I REMEMBER STOPPING THE ARGUMENT FOR A SECOND THINKING
IN MY HEAD THIS MIGHT MAKE AN INTERESTING FILM ONE DAY
AND THEN I WENT BACK TO MY ARGUMENT.
>> I MADE A DOCUMENTARY CALLED SOME MARBLE ARCH AND IN SAN
FRANCISCO THROUGH SAN FRANCISCO STATE UNIVERSITIES PROGRAM IT
WON SEVERAL AWARDS. IT TAUGHT INTERNATIONAL FILM
FESTIVAL FOR ABOUT 2 OR 3 YEARS AT EVERY FILM FESTIVAL THAT I
ATTENDED WHETHER IT WAS LGBTQ FILM FESTIVAL OR PEOPLE OF
COLOR FILM FESTIVAL OR HUMAN RIGHTS FILM FESTIVAL.
I FOUND MYSELF AMONG ONE HANDFUL OF WOMEN OF COLOR FILMMAKERS AND IT OCCURRED TO ME IF WE ARE NOT THE ONES
TELLING OUR OWN STORIES, OUR OWN LIVES, OUR OWN COMMUNITIES
,OUR OWN EXPERIENCES WHO WILL I KNEW AS AN INDEPENDENT
FILMMAKER I WOULD MAKE ONE FILM EVERY 3 TO 5 YEARS BECAUSE OF
THE FUNDRAISING INVOLVED. BUT I KNEW IF I TAUGHT FILMMAKING I COULD TEACH AN ART FORM THAT IS SO EXPENSIVE THAT
HAS AN ECONOMIC BARRIER ASSOCIATED WITH IT.
IN ONE YEAR IF I HAVE 40 PARTICIPANTS IN TEN YEARS I
WOULD HAVE HAD 400 PARTICIPANTS IN 25 YEARS WE HAVE HAD OVER
500 FILMS CREATED BY OUR WOMEN OF COLOR BY NON-BINARY
TRANSGENDER PEOPLE OF COLOR COMMUNITIES 500 PLUS FILMS.
NO OTHER ARTS INSTITUTION IN THE WORLD HAS THIS
COLLECTION OF FILMS ABOUT OUR COMMUNITY.
I WAS SO NOT TRYING TO START A NONPROFIT.
I WAS REALLY TRYING TO MAKE CHANGE AND IT HAPPENED TO BE
THROUGH FILM AND TEACHING. WE JUST PRESENTED OUR ANNUAL
FILM FESTIVAL WAS OUR 21ST WOMEN OF COLOR FILM FESTIVAL A
COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO AT THE PRESIDIO THEATER.
WE HAD OVER 1500 PEOPLE COME THROUGH THE THREE DAYS WE
SCREENED OVER 49 FILMS THROUGH SEVEN SCREENING PROGRAMS.
>> IT TOOK US 20 YEARS TO GROW OUR ORGANIZATION BUDGET TO
$500,000. 20 YEARS BECAUSE RACISM,
SEXISM, HOMOPHOBIA ARE BLATANT IN FUNDRAISING.
>> WOMEN OF COLOR ARE CONSTANTLY PERCEIVED AS A NICHE
WITHIN A NICHE WITHIN A NICHE WHEN IN FACT WE ARE REALLY
BRIDGES WHEN THAT HAPPENS OUR LIVES ARE DEVALUED, OUR WORK
DISMISSED. >> THIS YEAR MARKS OUR 25TH
ANNIVERSARY OF OUR ORGANIZATION. IT'S A HUGE MILESTONE FOR US. HOWEVER, IN MARCH UNFORTUNATELY
WE HAD A GRANT TWO GRANTS ACTUALLY FROM THE SAN FRANCISCO HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION CANCELED AND $500,000 IS HALF
OF OUR ORGANIZATIONAL BUDGET. >> IT WAS NOT FAIR.
IT WAS WRONG. IT WAS UNJUST AND UNFORTUNATELY
THERE IS NO RECOURSE. >> IT WOULD HAVE SUPPORTED A
SECOND YEAR OF OUR CAREER AND TRANS BLACK FILMMAKERS
ARTISTS FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM. NO SIMILAR PROGRAM EXISTS
IN THE ENTIRE COUNTRY EXCEPT HERE IN SAN FRANCISCO.
>> KWOK MAPP. THE SECOND GRANT WOULD HAVE
SUPPORTED A AND TRANS APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM. IT WOULD BOTH GRANTS WOULD HAVE DEVELOPED, WORKFORCE WOULD HAVE
BEEN WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT. THERE WERE 38 ORGANIZATIONS
THAT GOT THEIR GRANTS CANCELED. >> THEY WERE ALL PEOPLE OF
COLOR LED ORGANIZATIONS THAT SERVED PEOPLE OF COLOR COMMUNITIES. >> SO SAN FRANCISCO IS A BEACON
SHINING BRIGHTLY GLOBALLY. THIS BEACON IS MADE UP OF
HUNDREDS OF DIVERSE MULTIPLE LIGHTS LIGHTS THAT ARE OUR
GRASSROOTS COMMUNITY BASED NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS THAT
PROVIDE A MUCH NEEDED ANCHOR ESPECIALLY RIGHT NOW DURING
THIS TUMULTUOUS, UNPREDICTABLE STORMY PERIOD.
HUNDREDS OF LOCAL LIGHTS COMING TOGETHER TO CREATE THIS GLOBAL
BEACON THAT WE LIVE AND CALL HOME IN SAN FRANCISCO.
I IMPLORE YOU SUPPORT YOUR LOCAL ANCHOR ARTS AND CULTURE
ORGANIZATION QUAKE MAP IS LED IMMIGRANT LED PEOPLE OF COLOR
LED. PROTECT THE MOST VULNERABLE
AMONG US BECAUSE IF WE DON'T WHO WILL?
>> WE ARE CELEBRATING PRIDE. >> TO BE HONEST MY HEART IS
HEAVY. THIS BUDGET CUTS HAVE HAD AN
EMOTIONAL PHYSICAL MENTAL IMPACT TOLL ON ALL OF US.
WE HAVE BEEN OPERATING ON RESERVES ALL YEAR.
IT'S OUR 25TH ANNIVERSARY AND I AM AFRAID THAT OUR DOORS MIGHT
NOT STAY OPEN AFTER THIS YEAR. >> SO THANK YOU FOR THIS
RECOGNITION. >> IT IS MUCH APPRECIATED AND HAPPY PRIDE TO EVERYONE. ALL RIGHT COLLEAGUES.
THAT BRINGS US TO DISTRICT EIGHT AND I AM GOING TO BEG
YOUR FORGIVE THIS. LAST YEAR I OF COURSE FOR JUNE
WE GET VERY EXCITED ABOUT LINING UP SPECIAL LGBTQ
INDIVIDUALS TO GET HONORED AT EACH OF OUR TUESDAY BOARD
MEETINGS AND LAST WEEK BECAUSE OF CIRCUMSTANCES BEYOND OUR
CONTROL, OUR HONOREE WAS NOT ABLE TO BE HONORED AND SO I
INVITED HER TO COME BACK. BUT WE ALSO HAVE ANOTHER GREAT
HONOREE FOR TODAY SO WE'RE GOOD. I'M GIVING MYSELF A PRESIDENTIAL PRIVILEGE
PRIVILEGE TO DO 2 IN 1 DAY AND I BEG YOUR FORGIVENESS.
FIRST UP I'M GOING TO ASK RON GALLMAN TO COME UP.
>> SO RON IS THE SAN FRANCISCO SYMPHONY'S LONGTIME DIRECTOR OF
EDUCATION AND YOUTH ORCHESTRA AND HE IS RETIRING THIS MONTH
AFTER 42 YEARS OF SERVICE TO THE SYMPHONY. >> SINCE JOINING THE SYMPHONY STAFF IN 1983, RON HAS BEEN A
VISIONARY LEADER WHOSE WORK HAS TRANSFORMED THE WAY ORCHESTRAS

CONVICTION THAT MUSIC HAS THE POWER TO INSPIRE AND MOTIVATE
YOUNG MUSICIANS. >> HE LAUNCHED AND CONTINUOUSLY

ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS SINCE 1988. HE'S OVERSEEN CONCERTS FOR KIDS
MUSIC FOR FAMILIES INSIDE MUSIC AND SFX KIDS.ORG THE SYMPHONY'S

>> HIS COMMITMENT TO YOUNG MUSICIANS IS PERHAPS BEST REFLECTED IN HIS STEWARDSHIP OF THE SAN FRANCISCO SYMPHONY
YOUTH ORCHESTRA, WHICH HAS FLOURISHED UNDER HIS GUIDANCE
AS ONE OF THE FINEST ENSEMBLES OF ITS KIND IN THE WORLD.
RON ALSO CHAMPIONED LIFELONG LEARNING AND COMMUNITY
ENGAGEMENT THROUGH PROGRAMS LIKE COMMUNITY OF MUSIC MAKERS
WHICH BROUGHT AMATEUR MUSICIANS ONTO THE STAGE AT DAVIS SYMPHONY HALL TO MAKE MUSIC ALONGSIDE SYMPHONY
PROFESSIONALS ACROSS EVERY INITIATIVE.
RON HAS ENSURED THAT THE SYMPHONY'S EDUCATIONAL OFFERINGS REFLECT THE HIGHEST STANDARDS OF EXCELLENCE, ACCESS
AND INCLUSION. IN ADDITION TO HIS WORK AT THE
SYMPHONY, RON HAS BEEN A POWERFUL ADVOCATE FOR ARTS
EDUCATION AT THE LOCAL, STATE AND NATIONAL LEVELS. HE'S REPRESENTED SAN FRANCISCO AT CONFERENCES HOSTED BY THE
LEAGUE OF AMERICAN ORCHESTRAS, AMERICANS FOR THE ARTS AND THE
ARTS EDUCATION PARTNERSHIP AND HAS SERVED ON PANELS FOR

>> CONGRATULATIONS RON AND HAPPY RETIREMENT.
>> THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH. PRESIDENT MANDOLIN AND THANK YOU TO THE BOARD OF
SUPERVISORS. OF COURSE, AS YOU CAN IMAGINE,
I'M DEEPLY, DEEPLY HONORED TO RECEIVE THIS COMMENDATION.
IT'S WONDERFUL TO BE RECOGNIZED FOR 42 YEARS OF REALLY
DEDICATION AND SERVICE TO THE CAUSE OF THE ARTS AND ARTS
EDUCATION IN SAN FRANCISCO. >> MY WORK HAS BEEN WORKING
WITH THE ARTS ENSURING THAT EVERYONE HAS A PLACE IN THE
ARTS AND THAT THE ARTS CAN SERVE EVERYONE IN OUR CITY
AND ESPECIALLY SAN FRANCISCO'S PUBLIC SCHOOL CHILDREN.
BUT ALSO REACHING EVERY COMMUNITY OF SAN FRANCISCO OUR
STATE NATIONALLY AND BEYOND INTERNATIONALLY I MUST THANK
AND GIVE CREDIT TO THE SAN FRANCISCO SYMPHONY FOR ITS
ONGOING INVESTMENT IN MUSIC EDUCATION IN THIS CITY THAT
REALLY HAS FUELED MY WORK OVER THESE PAST FOUR DECADES.
BEING ASSOCIATED WITH AN ORGANIZATION THAT IS SO
COMMITTED TO ENSURING THAT AS A CORE PART OF ITS MISSION THAT
IT SERVES ITS COMMUNITY THROUGH ART AND ARTS EDUCATION SERVICES
AND OF COURSE I AM VERY, VERY PLEASED AND VERY MUCH INSPIRED
BY THE LONG STANDING RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE
SYMPHONY AND THE SAN FRANCISCO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT.
MY WORK WITH THE SAN FRANCISCO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT IS ALSO
ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE ASPECTS THAT HAS FUELED ME WORKING
IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE DISTRICT TO ENSURE THAT EVERY
SINGLE CHILD IN SAN FRANCISCO GETS A WELL-ROUNDED
AND BALANCED EDUCATION THAT INCLUDES MUSIC AND THE ARTS.
>> I WOULD SAY THAT WE ALL KNOW THAT SUPPORT FOR THE ARTS IS
CRITICAL IN KEEPING SAN FRANCISCO THIS CITY VIBRANT.
>> AND AS I STEP DOWN FROM MY ROLE AS THE SAN FRANCISCO
SYMPHONY'S DIRECTOR OF EDUCATION AND YOUTH ORCHESTRA
AFTER 42 YEARS I VERY MUCH AM LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING
WATCHING AND DOING WHAT I CAN TO HELP CONTINUE TO ENSURE THAT
THE ARTS REALLY REMAIN VIBRANT ,THAT THEY GROW AND THAT THEY
THRIVE BECAUSE THOSE CAN ONLY BE GOOD THINGS FOR US.
THE CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO. >> SO THANK YOU VERY, VERY MUCH
. >> I'M VERY, VERY HONORED
>> ONE WEEK LATE. REBECCA RALPH, COME ON UP.
>> REBECCA HAS SPENT A LOT OF TIME IN THIS CHAMBER OVER THE
YEARS IN JUNE. IT HAS NOT ALWAYS BEEN
ENJOYABLE AND YOU'VE GOT TO SIT THROUGH TO SPECIAL
ACCOMMODATIONS. >> SO THANK YOU FOR STICKING WITH IT FOR THIS FINAL TUESDAY OF PRIDE MONTH.
>> IT IS MY HONOR TO PRESENT A SPECIAL COMMENDATION TO REBECCA RALPH WHO WILL BE RETIRING LATER THIS YEAR FROM THE SAN
FRANCISCO LGBT CENTER WHICH SHE HAS LED SO VERY CAPABLY FOR 17
YEARS. >> SHE JOINED THE CENTER STAFF
IN 2003 AS THE DEPUTY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR ONE YEAR AFTER IT
FIRST OPENED ITS DOORS AT 1800 MARKET STREET.
IN THAT ROLE SHE OVERSAW THE ORGANIZATION'S BUDGET STAFF
AND COMMUNITY PROGRAMS. >> IN APRIL OF 2007 THE BOARD
SELECTED HER TO SERVE AS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR.
SHE WOULD TURN OUT TO HAVE BEEN AN INSPIRED CHOICE DURING HER
NEARLY TWO DECADES LEADING THE CENTER. SHE HAS HELPED TO MAKE IT ONE OF SAN FRANCISCO'S INDICES
SENSIBLE ORGANIZATIONS A COMMUNITY HUB THAT OFFERS HOUSING RESOURCES, EMPLOYMENT AND FINANCIAL SERVICES, ARTS
AND CULTURE PROGRAMING AND SUPPORT FOR YOUTH AND TRANS
COMMUNITIES. THE MISSION OF THE LGBT CENTER
IS TO CONNECT OUR DIVERSE COMMUNITY TO OPPORTUNITIES,
RESOURCES AND EACH OTHER TO ACHIEVE OUR VISION OF A
STRONGER, HEALTHIER AND MORE EQUITABLE WORLD FOR LGBT PEOPLE
AND OUR ALLIES. >> THE MISSION IS AN INSPIRING
ONE BUT I DO NOT BELIEVE THE CENTER WOULD HAVE SURVIVED TO
FULFILL THAT MISSION WITHOUT REBECCA'S LEADERSHIP. >> INDEED, IN ITS EARLY DAYS BURDENED BY CRUSHING
CONSTRUCTION, DEBT AND FINANCES THAT AS A CONSEQUENCE NEVER
QUITE BALANCED OUT THE CENTER'S SURVIVAL WAS AN OPEN QUESTION.
IN 2017 REBECCA AND HER BOARD PUT THAT QUESTION TO REST WITH
A $10.3 MILLION NEUMARK NEW MARKET TAX CREDIT FUNDED MAJOR
CAPITAL REMODEL THAT REMADE THE PHYSICAL STRUCTURE TO BETTER SERVE COMMUNITY NEEDS AND GENERATE MORE REVENUE FOR
THE CENTER'S ONGOING OPERATIONS .
>> BEFORE SHE JOINED THE CENTER, REBECCA SERVED EIGHT
YEARS AS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR SAN FRANCISCO WOMEN AGAINST RAPE MANAGING ITS BUDGET, DEVELOPING AND EXPANDING ITS
PROGRAMS AND RAISING GRANT FUNDS TO SUSTAIN A COMMUNITY
BASED RAPE RAPE CRISIS CENTER AND BETWEEN HER EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR ROLES, REBECCA WORKED AS A POLICY ANALYST FOR OUR OWN
DEPARTMENT ON THE STATUS OF WOMEN.
HER WORK INVOLVED ANALYZING DATA RELATED TO GENDER DISCRIMINATION ISSUES AFFECTING WOMEN AND MAKING
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR NEW POLICY .
>> REBECCA YOU HAVE ACCOMPLISHED AMAZING THINGS IN YOUR PROFESSIONAL LIFE AND ESPECIALLY AT THE CENTER OF
THESE LAST 22 YEARS. IT HAS BEEN A PRIVILEGE TO BE
ABLE TO WORK WITH YOU, TO LEARN FROM YOU, TO BENEFIT FROM YOUR
COUNSEL. YOU RETIREMENT IS VERY
WELL-DESERVED BUT NONETHELESS BITTERSWEET FOR ME.
>> I DON'T WANT TO SAY I WILL MISS YOU BECAUSE I VERY MUCH
HOPE AND STRONGLY SUSPECT THAT YOU WILL CONTINUE TO FIND WAYS
TO ENGAGE IN THE FIGHTS FOR JUSTICE AND EQUALITY AND A MORE
PERFECT SAN FRANCISCO. FOR NOW I WILL JUST SAY REBECCA
RALPH, WE LOVE YOU VERY, VERY MUCH.
WE THANK YOU VERY, VERY MUCH. AND WITH THAT THE FLOOR IS YOURS. >> THANK YOU SO MUCH, PRESIDENT
MANDELL MEN AND THANK YOU SO MUCH TO THE BOARD OF
SUPERVISORS. I HAVE SPENT A LOT OF TIME IN THIS CHAMBER AS RECENTLY AS YESTERDAY WHEN I HAD ONE MINUTE
LIMIT AND I WAS LIKE I'LL BE BACK TOMORROW.
>> NOW I KNOW YOUR HOSTAGE BUT I REALLY WANT TO ACCEPT THIS
AWARD ON BEHALF OF A COMMUNITY THAT THE COMMUNITY HERE IN SAN

COMMUNITY THAT WE ARE PART OF AND SERVE.
I WANT TO THANK THE PEOPLE THE CENTER'S BEEN A LABOR OF LOVE
NOT JUST FOR ME BUT FOR SO MANY PEOPLE WHO HAVE LABORED SO HARD
TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS AN INSTITUTION THAT LASTS FOR OUR
COMMUNITY AND THAT WHAT WE OFFER EVERY SINGLE DAY REALLY
SPEAKS TO THE BROAD NEEDS OF OUR COMMUNITY AND THAT WE
CONTINUE TO BE HERE TO TO MEET THOSE NEEDS TO FILL IN THE GAPS
TO IDENTIFY WHAT'S EMERGING BECAUSE THE TRUTH IS THAT
ACROSS THE COUNTRY OUR COMMUNITY IS UNDER ATTACK
AND THAT INCLUDES HERE IN SAN FRANCISCO ESPECIALLY TRANS
AND NON-BINARY INDIVIDUALS ALONG WITH IMMIGRANTS AND ASYLUM SEEKERS, BLACK FOLKS WE ARE ALL UNDER ATTACK.
>> THE HATRED THAT WE ARE WITNESSING IS NOT NEW BUT IT IS
ESCALATING FROM POLICIES THAT SEEK TO ERASE OUR VERY
EXISTENCE TO WIDESPREAD FUNDING CUTS TO VITAL SAFETY NET
PROGRAMS TO THE TARGETING OF THOSE WHO DARE TO SPEAK OUT
AGAINST DISCRIMINATION AND RISING FASCISM. THE THREATS ARE IMMINENT. EVEN IN SAN FRANCISCO WE
CONTINUE TO FACE THE IMPACT OF HOMOPHOBIA TRANSPHOBIA AND THE
IMPACT THE INTERSECTIONS OF RACISM AND GENDER BIAS
IN HOUSING, HEALTH CARE, EMPLOYMENT AND SAFETY.
AT THE SAME TIME WE'RE SEEING MORE PEOPLE ARRIVE SEEKING
SANCTUARY RESOURCES AND REFUGE. WE OWE IT TO EACH OTHER TO BE
READY TO MEET THAT NEED. >> AND ALL THIS IS HAPPENING AT
A TIME WHEN WE ARE FACING HUGE BUDGET CHALLENGES FROM THE
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND AT A LOCAL LEVEL AND THESE ARE IMPACTING OUR PROGRAMS AND SERVICES AND AND RESULTING
IN REDUCED SERVICES FOR OUR COMMUNITY.
MOST TRAGICALLY FOR THE MOST VULNERABLE AND VULNERABLE
MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY. >> LEADERSHIP MATTERS. I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR RECOGNIZING MY LEADERSHIP BUT
NO ONE LEADER CAN SOLVE WHAT WE'RE UP AGAINST.
>> IT IS GOING TO TAKE ALL OF US. I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH PARTNERSHIP
IN PARTNERSHIP WITH ALL OF YOU WITH THE INCREDIBLE ORGANIZATIONS THAT MAKE UP THE FABRIC OF THIS COMMUNITY
IN THIS CITY WITH THE MANY CITIZENS THE COMMUNITY, ALL OF
OUR ALLIED COMMUNITIES BECAUSE TO FIND A SOLUTION WE NEED EACH
OTHER. WE NEED TO PROTECT EACH OTHER.
WE NEED TO SHOW UP FOR COMMUNITY. WE NEED TO SHOW UP FOR EACH OTHER AND WE NEED TO INVEST
IN THE ORGANIZATIONS THAT WE WANT TO SEE UNDER THIS MOMENT.
SO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS ON BEHALF OF COMMUNITY IT IS MY
PLEASURE AND MY HONOR TO SERVE SUCH AN INCREDIBLE COMMUNITY AND TO STAND WITH SO MANY AMAZING LEADERS WHO ARE HONORED
HERE TODAY. I'M A LITTLE INTIMIDATED BUT
IT'S IT'S JUST A PLEASURE AND AN HONOR. SO THANK YOU SO MUCH

>> WELCOME. ALL RIGHT. YOU KNOW THERE'S SO MANY LIES TOLD I COULDN'T PUT IT BETTER
THAN A DIVINE SENTENCE IS IN THE LIPS OF THE KING HIS
MOUTH TRANSGRESSES DID NOT IN JUDGMENT ADJUST, WAIT
AND BALANCE ARE THE LORDS ALL THE WEIGHTS OF THE BAG ARE HIS
WORK. IT IS AN ABOMINATION TO KINGS
AND YOU'RE ALL LIKE LITTLE KINGS RIGHT? BUT IT SAYS HERE IT'S AN ABOMINATION TO KINGS TO COMMIT
WICKEDNESS. YES, BECAUSE THE THRONE IS
ESTABLISHED BY RIGHTEOUSNESS. RIGHTEOUS LIPS ARE THE DELIGHT
OF KINGS AND THEY LOVE HIM. THAT SPEAK IS RIGHT.
THE WRATH OF THE KING IS AS A MESSENGERS OF DEATH.
BUT A WISE MAN WILL PACIFY IT. PRIDE GOETH BEFORE DESTRUCTION
AND IN HAUGHTY SPIRIT BEFORE A FALL BETTER IT IS TO BE OF A
HUMBLE SPIRIT WITH THE LOWLY THAN TO DIVIDE THE SPOIL WITH THE PROUD PRIDE IS ALWAYS SPOKEN OF IN A NEGATIVE MANNER
AND THE WORD OF GOD IT'S IT'S ALWAYS SPOKEN OF BUT IF YOU'RE
PROUD ABOUT SIN IF I'M PROUD ABOUT BEING A LADIES MAN YOU
KNOW I SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF BEING A LADIES MAN IF I WAS A
LADIES MAN AND YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED IF YOU'RE A HOMOSEXUAL
,GOD CONDEMNS IT. IT DOESN'T MEAN YOU CANNOT BE FORGIVEN BUT IT DOES MEAN THAT GOD GOD CONDEMNS IT.
THERE HAVE BEEN PEOPLE THAT USED TO BE HOMOSEXUALS, YOU
KNOW, AND THEN THEY GOT SAVED. >> I USED TO PREACH WITH THE
GUY AT U.C. BERKELEY. WHAT'S HIS NAME?
HE WAS A MANAGER OF A GAY BAR AND HE BECAME A CHRISTIAN.
I FORGOT THE GUY'S NAME BUT JESUS IS COMING SOON.
HE REALLY IS. WHEN TRUMP MADE HIS EASTER PROFESSION THAT WAS AFTER 360 SABBATICAL CYCLES AND 360
MONTHS FROM THE START OF THE TIMES OF THE GENTILES THAT
JESUS DEATH AND RESURRECTION WAS THE GREATEST EVENT
IN HISTORY AND IT WAS HIS COMING SOON CALL OUT TO HIM TODAY. >> THANK YOU, MARK.
LET'S HEAR FROM OUR NEXT SPEAKER.
>> I HAVE A HANDOUT. WE'LL COME AND COLLECT THAT
FROM YOU. >> GOOD AFTERNOON BOARD OF
SUPERVISORS. FOR THE RECORD, MY NAME IS CHRIS FORD KLEIN. I ALSO GO BY SERGEANT KLEIN OF
THE UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS. I JUST PASSED OUT A PORTION OF A DOCUMENT THAT WAS SUBMITTED TO FEDERAL COURT AND I HAVE
UNTIL JULY 14TH 2025 TO FILE AN AMENDED CLAIM WITH SPECIFIC
INCIDENTS FOR EACH ONE OF THE FOUR QUESTIONS PAY PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO QUESTIONS TWO AND THREE WHEN VIOLATIONS OF
THE GUIDELINES. HOWEVER, TODAY I'M ASKING THE
CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO TO JOIN FORCES FORCES
WITH ME IN A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT AGAINST STATE SPONSORED
TERRORISM SO THAT THE VICTIMS IN SAN FRANCISCO CAN RECEIVE FUNDS FROM CONGRESS FROM THE CONGRESS ENACTED BY STATUTE
FUND SET UP FOR US VICTIMS OF STATE SPONSORED TERRORISM SINCE
SAN FRANCISCO WAS VICTIMIZED FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS SUCH AS POLITICIANS THAT REPRESENT SAN FRANCISCO BE IT AT THE
LOCAL, STATE AND FEDERAL LEVEL YOU HOST FLEET WEEK EVERY YEAR
THERE'S A LARGE VETERAN POPULATION AND THERE ARE STILL
A MILITARY PRESENCE IN OR AROUND SAN FRANCISCO TO INCLUDE
THE 23RD MARINES TRAVIS AIR FORCE BASE AND PILLAR POINT AIR
FORCE BASE THAT IS CURRENTLY BEING BEING USED FOR U.S. SPACE
FORCE AND SEVERAL OTHER UNITS. UNFORTUNATELY, THE DEADLINE FOR
THE SIXTH INSTALLMENT HAS PASSED.
I URGE EACH OF YOU IN THIS ROOM TO PARTNER AND JOIN FORCES SO THAT THE VICTIMS CAN BE COMPENSATED AND SAN FRANCISCO
CAN GET ITS FAIR SHARE OF THE FUND.
THE DEADLINE JUST PASSED WAS ON JUNE 2ND, 2025 AND I PREVIOUSLY
PRESENTED PRIOR TO THAT DATE. I'M CONFUSED AND DISMAYED BY
SEVERAL WHO HAVE REFUSED TO MOVE ON THIS AT A MUCH QUICKER
PACE AS SAN FRANCISCO SUFFERS PERHAPS ONE OF ITS MOST
FINANCIAL DOWNFALLS IN HISTORY .
LET'S WORK TOGETHER SAN FRANCISCO NOT AGAINST EACH OTHER AGAIN THERE'S GOING TO BE ANOTHER DATE BUT THAT DOESN'T
FIX YOUR BUDGET FOR THIS YEAR AND NEXT YEAR.
IF IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SUBMITTED ON TIME THERE WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN A BUDGET ISSUE THIS YEAR. >> THANK YOU.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS. NEXT SPEAKER I HAVE A HANDOUT
FOR EACH ONE OF YOUR BOARD SUPERVISORS.
I'M ASKING FOR THE POLICE DEPARTMENT TO HAVE FACIAL
RECOGNITION AND THE POLICE DEPARTMENT.
THAT'S WHAT THE LETTERS REGARDING IT'S FOR EVERY ONE OF
THEM. PLEASE CONTINUE.

THANK YOU FOR YOUR LETTER TO THEM AND FOR YOUR TO READ IT
AND NOT JUST LOOK AT IT. TAKE IT REAL SERIOUS.
>> THANK YOU. THANK YOU.
LET'S HEAR FROM OUR NEXT SPEAKER. WELCOME. >> GOOD AFTERNOON.
CITY SUPERVISORS AND FELLOW ESTEEMED NEUROSCIENTISTS.
IT'S PRIDE WEEK AS WE'RE ALL AWARE. >> AND FOR ME AND MY FAMILY AND FOR MUCH OF SAN FRANCISCO,

TO GET. >> BUT IT'S DIRE TIMES. AND RECENTLY THE FBI HAS SET UP A HOTLINE FOR ANYONE TO CALL
IN TO REPORT HEALTH CLINICS THAT MIGHT BE HARMING CHILDREN
BY QUOTE PERFORMING GENITAL MUTILATION. NOW THIS IS A THINLY VEILED ATTEMPT AT ANTI-TRANS
PROPAGANDA SPECIFICALLY ANTI GENDER AFFIRMING CARE
PROPAGANDA. >> IT'S A VILE ACT.
NOW READING THE WRITING ON THE WALL UCSF, STANFORD AND THE
GENDER CONFIRMING CENTER HERE RIGHT HERE HAVE ALL CEASED
PROVIDING GENDER AFFIRMING CARE FOR ANYONE UNDER 19.
THAT HAPPENED THIS WEEK NOT TO BE UNDONE AN ACTS OF ABJECT
COWARDICE OUR MAYOR SOMEHOW EITHER ACCIDENTALLY BUT VERY
LIKELY PURPOSEFULLY DID NOT INCLUDE THE TRANS FLAG IN THE
PRIDE FLAG RAISING CEREMONY AT CITY HALL.
NOW THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT THIS HAS HAPPENED SINCE I CAN REMEMBER. WE HAVE LOTS OF PHOTOGRAPHIC
EVIDENCE SHOWING THE TRANS FLAG RIGHT THERE BEHIND EVERY MAYOR SPEECH FOR AS LONG AS I CAN REMEMBER.
THAT DID NOT HAPPEN THIS YEAR. IT'S NOT SURPRISING FOR A
CONSERVATIVE MAYOR WHO IS COOPERATING WITH ICE, BUT IT IS QUITE FRANKLY A SURPRISE FOR THIS CITY.
NOW YOUR JOB AS LEGISLATURES AS A LEGISLATIVE BRANCH OF THIS
GOVERNMENT AND I CAN'T BELIEVE I HAVE TO TELL YOU THIS BUT I DO YOUR JOBS IS TO CHECK THE MAYOR'S EXECUTIVE POWER.
IT IS NOT TO STAND BEHIND HIM IN SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS SMILING
LIKE YOU'RE HIS PERSONAL ASSISTANT READY TO DO HIS
BIDDING. HE'S NOT YOUR CONSTITUENCY.
WE ARE THE PEOPLE OF SAN FRANCISCO.
>> AH, IT'S TUESDAY PRIDE MARCH IS SUNDAY.

DEVASTATING CUTS TO OUR CITY'S SOCIAL SAFETY NET.
THE MAYOR HAS CHOSEN TO BALANCE THE BUDGET BY SLASHING ESSENTIAL SERVICES LIKE LEGAL AID, WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT,
FOOD BANKS AND HOMELESSNESS SERVICES FOR FAMILIES
AND TRANSITIONAL AGED YOUTH. >> AT THE SAME TIME, SOME OF
THE RICHEST CORPORATIONS IN THE CITY NAMELY AIRBNB, UBER AND LYFT HAVE SUED THE CITY FOR OVER $400 MILLION, PROMPTING
THE CITY COMPTROLLER TO PUT HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS
INTO A LITIGATION RESERVE. THAT MONEY COULD BE COVERING
ALL OF THE LAYOFFS AND ALL OF THE CUTS TO OUR SERVICES
IN THIS BUDGET SEVERAL TIMES OVER. WHY SHOULD OUR COMMUNITIES HAVE TO SUFFER BECAUSE OF THEIR
GREED? BILLIONAIRES AND CORPORATIONS
NEED TO PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE. THEY GOT RICH ON OUR BACKS. THEY SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO HOLD OUR TAX DOLLARS HOSTAGE.
>> WHOEVER OUR CITY IS PREVENTED FROM PASSING A WEALTH
TAX ON THOSE WHO HAVE EXPLOITED OUR LABOR, FLIPPED OUR HOMES
AND DISPLACED OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS TO GET RICH.
WE SUPPORT SUPERVISORS CHEN CHAN WALTON AND FIELDER'S
RESOLUTION AND CALL UPON OUR REPRESENTATIVES IN SACRAMENTO. ASSEMBLY MEMBER MATT HANEY, ASSEMBLY MEMBER CATHERINE
STEFANI AND SENATOR SCOTT WIENER TO PASS LEGISLATION THAT
WILL ALLOW LOCAL JURISDICTIONS LIKE OURS TO PASS A WEALTH TAX.

COMMUNITIES. THANK YOU.

>> HI, MR. WALTON. I KNOW YOU REPRESENT MY
DISTRICT. MA'AM, PLEASE ADDRESS YOUR
COMMENTS TO THE BOARD AS A WHOLE. >> I JUST SPOKE TO HIM. THAT'S ALL.
I KNOW HE'S A PART OF THE BOARD AS YOU ARE AND I HAVE NOT BEEN
PAID. I WAS IT WAS SETTLED
IN DECEMBER OF LAST YEAR. THE LAST TIME MY ATTORNEY WOULD
SPEAK TO ME WAS IN EARLY MARCH AND HE TOLD ME THAT BEFORE I
WOULD GET SETTLED THAT THE BOARD, THE SUPERVISORS AND THE
MAYOR YOUR CASE HAS TO GO BEFORE THEM.
NOW THERE'S THREE OTHER COWORKERS OF MINE THAT WAS
FIRED FROM THE HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION AND THEY DIDN'T WAIT
NO TEN NO SEVEN MONTHS. AND I'M HERE TO SAY THAT I HAD
A GOOD EXPERIENCE WORKING FOR THE CITY. BUT YOU NEED TO TAKE A CLOSE LOOK AT WHO YOU HIRE FOR
DIRECTORS AND MANAGERS BECAUSE THOSE PEOPLE ARE NOT ON THE
SAME WAVELENGTH AS YOU. THEY WANT YOU TO DO WHAT THEY
WANT YOU TO DO. THEY DON'T WANT YOU TO OBEY THE
RULES AND REGULATIONS. AND I'M AN OLD FARM GIRL.
>> WE CROP TOBACCO. YOU HAD ONE WAY TO DO IT
AND THAT WAS RIGHT. >> WITH THESE CITY MANAGERS AND DIRECTORS THEY ARE. >> THEY ARE LASCIVIOUS, SNEAKY
AND I WAS HERE A MONTH AGO. THE LADY IN THE PINK OVER THERE
IS THE ONE THAT HAD SOMEONE TO GET MY PHONE NUMBER
AND PERSONAL INFORMATION EMAIL AND SO FORTH. >> I HAVEN'T HEARD FROM NOBODY. I WENT DOWN TO MY LAWYER'S
OFFICE WITH CITY HE I DON'T KNOW IF HE WAS IN THERE OR NOT
KNOCKED ON HIS DOOR. HE DIDN'T ASK TWICE THOUGH NOT

THIS IS THE WARM WELCOME YOU'LL RECEIVE FROM DIANA DEL DELGADO
AND FELLOW EMPLOYEES OF SIMCOE RESTAURANTS AT PIER 39.
IF YOU'RE NOT PRIVY TO BEING A FOREIGN NATIONAL OFF OUR OWN
OUR OWN BEING CITIZENS. >> LET ME ASK COULD I MAKE SUCH
A STATEMENT WITHOUT BEING CHARGED WITH A HATE CRIME?
COULD I MAKE SUCH A STATEMENT AND RETAIN MY EMPLOYMENT?
COULD I MAKE SUCH A STATEMENT AND NOT BE DEFINED A FASCIST?
TO BE CLEAR I AM FOR INTEGRATION BUT WHAT I'M NOT FOR IS FOR FOREIGN CITIZENS OFF OUR OWN WHETHER THAT BE BY
DENIAL OF WAGES, STEALING OUR JOBS OR MURDERING US WITH DRUGS
WHILE HOLDING US TO STANDARDS THEY DO NOT FOLLOW THEMSELVES.
TO ANYONE FOR REPARATIONS FOR DEAD ANCESTORS THEY NEVER KNEW.
DON'T FORGET MINE FOR BEING STRANGLED FOR 35 MINUTES TO
THEN BE CHARGED WITH CRIMINAL DAMAGE TO PROPERTY AND SPEND
FOUR MONTHS IN CUSTODY FOR TAKING DOWN A CURTAIN WITH ON
IT. AMONG THE OTHER COUNTLESS CRIMES COMMITTED BY THE OF EVERY RACE THAT MAKES
EVERYTHING A RACE ISSUE INSTEAD OF A MUTUAL RESPECT ISSUE.

POLICE BUDGET WITH MORE THAN THREE QUARTERS OF THOSE

DESPITE THE PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT HAVING A $3.2
BILLION BUDGET DURING MY MOST RECENT INCARCERATION I WITNESSED MULTIPLE INDIVIDUALS REMAINING WITH IN THEIR PANTS
FOR A WEEK AT A TIME. >> SPEAKERS TIME'S EXPIRED.

THE BUDGET COMMITTEE. >> YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE AND AND
MEETING AND ABOUT AND TO US AS WELL AS THE 2016 VOTERS VOTED
FOR A FREE CITY COLLEGE AND IS THAT SO?
WELL LIKE TWO YEARS LATER 2019 A BUDGET WAS WE VOTED TO HAVE
TEN YEARS OF CITY COLLEGE FREE AND SO AS PROMISED WE SUPPOSED
TO HAVE CITY CARS SUPPOSED TO BE FREE AND THAT WE ARE SUPPOSED TO HAVE THE 40 MILLION I BELIEVE IN 20 2425 BUT WE
ONLY GOT HALF OF THAT. AND THAT IS IS PROBLEM IS THAT
WILL GET LIKE 7.2 BUT IT GOT UP TO I BELIEVE 9.3 BUT THAT IS
NOT ENOUGH IS LIKE WE FELL SHORT SO I JUST URGE YOU THAT
YOU CAN PUT MORE MONEY INTO TO PLAY FOR LIKE 17 OR 18 MILL

NEXT SPEAKER PLEASE. OH, WE WAS HERE TO SPEAK ON
BEHALF OF OUR MOTHER. SHE JUST CAME UP TO YOU GUYS
AND HANDED OUT A LETTER. WE JUST WANTED TO READ PART OF
THE LETTER BASICALLY REGARDING INJUSTICE WHAT OUR BROTHER WHO
GOT KILLED LAST YEAR. WE JUST WANTED TO SEE IF IT'S
POSSIBLE TO PASS THE LAW FOR THE FOR FACIAL RECOGNITION.
>> BUT WE'LL READ YOU PART OF THE LETTER I AM WRITING TO
RESPECTFULLY URGE THE BOARD TO REVISIT AND RECONSIDER THE
CURRENT POLICY PROHIBITING THE USE OF FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY BY LAW ENFORCEMENT IN SAN FRANCISCO WHO AS A
CONCERNED RESIDENT AND ADVOCATE FOR PUBLIC SAFETY. I BELIEVE THAT WITH APPROPRIATE SAFEGUARDS THIS TECHNOLOGY CAN
BE A POWERFUL TOOL TO ENHANCE PUBLIC SAFETY, ASSIST
INVESTIGATIONS AND IMPROVE THE OVERALL EFFECTIVENESS OF POLICE
WORK WHEN USED RESPONSIBLY AND INTEREST IN TRANSPARENTLY
FACIAL RECOGNITION CAN HELP IDENTIFY SUSPECTS IN SERIOUS
CRIMES LOCATED LOCATE MISSING PERSONS, MISSING PEOPLE
AND PREVENT REAL TIME THREATS. MANY MAJOR CITIES AROUND THE
WORLD ARE SUCCESSFULLY INCORPORATING THIS TECHNOLOGY
INTO THEIR PUBLIC SAFETY STRATEGIES. SAN FRANCISCO AS A PUBLIC LEADER IN BOTH TECH INNOVATIONS
AND CIVIL RIGHTS IS UNIQUELY POSITIONED TO SET THE STANDARD
FOR ETHICAL AND REGULATED USE. SO WE JUST WANTED TO BRING THAT
UP TO TO YOUR KNOWLEDGE, JUST BECAUSE SAN FRANCISCO DOES NOT
HAVE A FACIAL RECOGNITION THING FOR S.F. PD AND WE WERE JUST
WONDERING IF IT CAN GET WAIVED SO AND YEAH, THAT'S ALL WE
WANTED TO SAY FURTHER. >> THANK YOU.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS. NEXT SPEAKER OH YOU KNOW I LIKE
TO USE THE OVERHEAD AS I'VE GOT TO BE.

OUR CHILDREN THAT ARE BEING MURDERED ON THE STREET AREN'T

SON ALL THE TIME SAYING HE'S ONE OF THOSE CHILDREN.
MY SON WAS SHOT WITH A SEMIAUTOMATIC GUN.
30 ROUNDS OF BULLETS LEFT THAT GUN TO MY SON SAVING SOMEONE
ELSE'S LIFE. >> I COME HERE AND I SAID I
DON'T JUST FIGHT FOR MY CHILD BUT I THINK ABOUT ALL OTHER
MOTHERS AND FATHERS THAT ARE OUT THERE SUFFERING.
>> LOOK AT ALL THESE UNSOLVED HOMICIDES AND MURDERS THAT ARE
NOT SOLVED AND MOTHERS LIKE MYSELF AND OTHER MOTHERS ARE
STILL SUFFERING IN SILENCE. >> THIS IS THE PICTURE I WALK
WITH THE MAYOR AND AND ASKED HIM, YOU KNOW, I KNOW I BELIEVE

OH, THANK. >> GOOD AFTERNOON.
MY NAME IS RICHARD. STEVE PETERSON TO THE BOARD
AND TO THE SUPERVISOR AT LARGE .
YOU KNOW I WANT TO APOLOGIZE. I USED TO BE A FAIRLY DECENT
EXTEMPORANEOUS SPEAKER WHEN I WAS A TRIAL ATTORNEY SINCE LONG
COVERED IN A COUPLE OF STROKES I'VE BEEN IN MY MIND HAS BEEN A
LITTLE WILD AND THAT'S WHY I'VE GOT OUT OF INTELLECTUAL
PROPERTY LAW AND NOW INTO FORTUNE TELLING BECAUSE FORTUNE
TELLING IS FAR MORE EASY AND PREDICTIVE AND IF YOU'VE
SEEN THE ADS ON TV FOR A LAWYERS APPARENTLY YOU CAN SAY
PRETTY MUCH WHAT YOU WANT AS A FORTUNE TELLER.
THERE ARE INNUMERABLE NUMBER OF RESTRICTIONS INCLUDING
ADVERTISING AND AND I DON'T KNOW HOW I'M SUPPOSED TO
CONTACT CLIENTS I MEAN PSYCHIC LEE IS THAT THE WAY BUT I'M THE
TOPIC I REALLY WANT TO TALK ABOUT IS PRODUCTIVE PROTESTS.
AS YOU KNOW LAST WEEK THIS MEETING WAS DISRUPTED FOR ABOUT
FOUR HOURS BY A SO-CALLED CITY SERVICE REP UNION SERVING THE
PUBLIC AND AS A PUBLIC MEMBER I ONLY CAN I ONLY CAN STAND AND I
ONLY CAN STAY SO LONG BEFORE ALL OF A SUDDEN I'M GOING TO
EITHER FALL DOWN. THAT'S WHY I WEAR A PROTECTIVE
MOTORCYCLE JACKET OR NOT SO PRODUCTIVE.
THAT'S NOT AN EXAMPLE OF JUST THE DISRUPTIVE NATURE OF THAT
PROTEST WAS NOT PRODUCTIVE AND THERE ARE OTHER WAYS OF
PRODUCTIVE PROTESTS IF YOU SEE IN THE STREETS CERTAINLY THE NO
KINGS THING WHY ARE WE WAVING MEXICAN FLAGS?
I JUST DON'T KNOW. >> THINGS ARE SO TOPSY TURVY.
THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS.
GOOD AFTERNOON SUPERVISORS. THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME SPEAK
TODAY. MY NAME'S CURTIS BRADFORD
AND I'M JUST A TENDERLOIN RESIDENT AND I DO COMMUNITY ORGANIZING IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND AND IN THE CITY AND BUT I
REALLY WASN'T EVEN HERE TODAY TO SAY ANYTHING. I CAME FOR AN EVENT EARLIER BUT AFTER HEARING A COUPLE OF THE
COMMENTS TODAY I JUST FELT LIKE I WANTED TO GET UP AND SAY
SOMETHING TO THE FOLKS WHO ARE WATCHING WHICH IS MOST OF THE
FOLKS HERE IN SAN FRANCISCO ARE GOOD HEARTED FOLKS AND WE WE
CARE ABOUT EACH OTHER. WE LOVE EACH OTHER AND WE SUPPORT EACH OTHER. THE TENDERLOIN, FOR EXAMPLE, IS
PROBABLY THE MOST DIVERSE FOR NINE SQUARE BLOCKS IN AMERICA.
WE HAVE EVERY CREED, EVERY RACE ,EVERY RELIGION YOU KNOW,
EVERY LANGUAGE. IT IS EVERY SEXUALITY, EVERY
ORIENTATION AND GENDER IDENTITY .
IT IS AN AMAZING COMMUNITY AND WE DEMONSTRATE REGULARLY HOW WE CAN ALL LIVE TOGETHER, ENJOY IN PEACE AND SUPPORT EACH
OTHER. AND I JUST WANT FOLKS LISTENING WHO MIGHT HAVE HEARD SOME CONTRADICTORY MESSAGES TODAY

I SEE YOU. YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL. GOD SEES YOU. YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL.
AND I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW YOUR LOVED THANK YOU.
>> THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS. NEXT SPEAKER WHAT HAPPENED TO
ANGELA? SHE JUST FLEW AWAY.
IT'S LIKE OKAY, LET'S NOT FAKE FOR SURE IS THAT INTELLIGENCE
KNOWS THAT PRIDE IS IS ENEMY FIRE, RIGHT?
SUCH AS AFTER THAT THE STIGMATIZATION OF CALLS ON THIS
IT'S KIND OF ALMOST SURPRISING THAT YOU HAVEN'T TRIED YET A BLACK RAMBO NEVER MIND. I'VE GOT MORE IMPORTANT TO SAY
ABOUT THIS 5G TOWERS. YES. CONNECTED TO THE FACT THAT NO MATTER WHAT YOU CANNOT JUSTIFY
IT THEIR PRESENCE WHICH IS NEFARIOUS BY THE SAYING THAT IT
IS FOR HIGH SPEED INTERNET BECAUSE I SAID SEVERAL TIMES
BEFORE THAT SPEED IS DANGER. SO HIGH SPEED INTERNET MEANS NO
MATTER WHAT ARE YOU DANGER INTERNET CLEAR ENOUGH SO YES
NOW WHAT'S THE NEXT STAGE BECAUSE YOU HAVE NOW A ONE WEEK
TO START REMOVING MOST OF THESE 5G OR EVEN SIX I DON'T KNOW WHO
KNOWS THINGS THAT YOU DIDN'T ASK THE PEOPLE TO PUT ON.
>> I EXPLAINED THAT TO YOU LAST WEEK WHEN OKAY NO NEVER MIND.
>> HURRY UP. DON'T FORGET YOUR BREAKFAST
WITH YOUR ORANGE SIGNALIZATION FOR THE FAKE WORLD WORK ROADS
WORK SORRY THAT YOU PUT ON ABOUT THE COUNTRYSIDE TO PEACE AGAINST WORRY EVERYBODY OF THIS INCLUDES YOUR YELLOW
FLUORESCENT YELLOW GLOBALISTS THE SIGNS THE PRETENDING TO
CARE ABOUT PEDESTRIANS OH ANYBODY ANYBODY ELSE.
WHEREAS IT'S EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE A HURRY UP YOUR OWN

WITH LOVE GUIDED BY CULTURE AND INSPIRED BY HER
UNFORGETTABLE JOY. QUEEN AISHA EMBODY HER CULTURE
IN EVERY WAY THROUGH SONG, THROUGH DANCE AND THROUGH HER
UNWAVERING COMMITMENT TO PRESERVING AND CELEBRATING
PACIFIC ISLANDER TRADITIONS. >> ANYONE WHO WALK THE HALLS OF
AC DC KNEW WHEN THE QUEEN WAS PRESENT YOU COULD HEAR HER
SINGING CHURCH HYMNS WITH POWER AND GRACE FILLING THE SPACE
WITH SPIRIT AND SONG AT EVERY COMMUNITY EVENT.
QUEEN AISHA BROUGHT HER FULL AUTHENTIC SELF WITH PRIDE
AND CONFIDENCE. SHE DECLARED THE QUEEN IS HERE
AND THE ENTIRE ROOM WILL LIGHT UP IN RESPONSE.

SHE CREATED SPACE FOR OUR YOUTH TO FEEL SEEN, SUPPORTED
AND VALUE. >> HER PASSING IS A TREMENDOUS LOSS BUT HER LEGACY IS FOREVER. IT LIVES ON IN THE HEART OF AC
DC AND EVERY YOUNG PERSON SHE MENTORED AND IN THE STRENGTH OF
A COMMUNITY MADE BETTER BECAUSE SHE WAS PART OF IT.

THIS IS A RESOLUTION TO CONDEMN ANTI-SEMITISM AND ALL FORMS OF
RACE AND RELIGION BASED VIOLENCE IN SAN FRANCISCO
AND TO REAFFIRM ITS COMMITMENT TO AN OPEN, INCLUSIVE AND SAFE
CITY THAT ACTIVELY OPPOSES ALL FORMS OF HATE INCLUDING THOSE
BASED ON RELIGION, ETHNICITY, RACE, SEX, NATIONAL ORIGIN,
IMMIGRATION STATUS, SEXUAL ORIENTATION AND GENDER IDENTITY
OR EXPRESSION AND DISABILITY. >> THANK YOU, MADAM CLERK.
COLLEAGUES, I INTRODUCE THIS RESOLUTION LAST WEEK IN THE
WAKE OF A NUMBER OF RECENT ANTI-SEMITIC INCIDENTS LOCALLY
AND NATIONALLY. HERE IN SAN FRANCISCO WE'VE SEEN THE REPEATED TARGETING AND HARASSMENT OF PROMINENT
JEWISH INDIVIDUALS, BUSINESSES AND INSTITUTIONS.
WE'VE SEEN BULLYING AND EVEN VIOLENT ASSAULTS ON JEWS OF NO PARTICULAR PROMINENCE AT ALL IN THE UNITED STATES.
AT DIFFERENT TIMES IN OUR HISTORY IT HAS BEEN EASY FOR
AMERICAN JEWS TO IMAGINE THAT ANTI-SEMITISM IS NOT A THING HERE. I CERTAINLY BELIEVE THAT
GROWING UP IN SAN FRANCISCO MY GRANDMOTHER HAD COME TO THE UNITED STATES IN THE 50S BRINGING MY FATHER ACROSS THE
ATLANTIC ON A BOAT TO SURVIVOR OF A CONTINENT GONE GONE MAD.
>> SHE HAD SEEN ANTI-JEWISH HATE UP CLOSE AND HAD LOST MOST
OF HER FAMILY TO IT. BUT THAT WAS EUROPE IN A DIFFERENT TIME. THAT KIND OF THING JUST
COULDN'T HAPPEN IN THIS COUNTRY .
>> THE IRISH WRITER CONOR CRUISE ORION DESCRIBED ANTI-SEMITISM AS A LIGHT SLEEPER.
THAT OBSERVATION SEEMS PARTICULARLY RELEVANT TO THE CURRENT MOMENT IN THIS COUNTRY WHERE HATREDS OF ALL KINDS ARE
ROUSING ON THE RIGHT AND THE LEFT.
THE UNITED STATES IN 2025 IS OF COURSE NOT EUROPE IN 1933 BUT
ANCIENT BIGOTRIES DO SEEM TO FIND A WAY TO ADAPT THEMSELVES
TO CHANGING TIMES. AND JEWS NOW DO KNOW FROM OUR
HISTORY THAT THOSE HATREDS LEFT UNCHECKED CAN DO UNIMAGINABLE HARM. SO COLLEAGUES, I BELIEVE AT THE
VERY LEAST THIS IS A MOMENT FOR OUR BOARD OF SUPERVISORS TO SPEAK UP ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR FORM OF HATRED, TO CONDEMN IT
AND RECOMMIT OURSELVES TO ENSURING THAT SAN FRANCISCO
CONTINUES TO BE A WELCOMING CITY FOR JEWS AND FOR ALL
PEOPLE. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR UNANIMOUS CO-SPONSORSHIP. I WANT TO THANK J CRC AND I
WANT TO THANK ESPECIALLY SUPERVISOR MELGAR FOR YOUR INPUT ON LANGUAGE. >> AND I WANT TO THANK MELANIE
MATTHEW IN MY OFFICE FOR ALL OF HER WORK ON THIS.
AND I THINK WE CAN TAKE THAT ITEM SAME HOUSE, SAME CALL
WITHOUT OBJECTION THE RESOLUTION IS ADOPTED AND MADAM
CLERK, DO WE HAVE ANY IMPERATIVE AGENDA ITEMS?
>> THERE ARE NONE TO REPORT, MR. PRESIDENT.
>> THEN COULD YOU READ THE IN MEMORIAM? YESTERDAY'S MEETING WILL BE ADJOURNED IN MEMORY OF THE
FOLLOWING BELOVED INDIVIDUAL. ON BEHALF OF SUPERVISOR WALTON
FOR THE LATE ASIA ANTIGEN INNER I THINK THAT BRINGS US TO THE
END OF OUR AGENDA. MADAM CLERK IS THERE ANY FURTHER BUSINESS BEFORE US TODAY?
>> THAT CONCLUDES OUR BUSINESS FOR TODAY THEN WE ARE ADJOURNED
