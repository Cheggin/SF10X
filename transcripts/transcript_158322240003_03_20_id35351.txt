City and County of San Francisco Tuesday, March 03, 2020 >> President Yee: good afternoon, and welcome to the March 3, 2020 regular meeting of the san francisco board of supervisors. Madam Clerk, would you please call the roll. >> Clerk: thank you, Mr. President. [Roll Call] >> Clerk: Mr. President, you have a quorum. >> President Yee: thank you. Would you please join me in the pledge of allegiance. [Pledge of allegiance] >> President Yee: on behalf of the board, I would like to acknowledge the staff of sfgovtv, colina and michael, who record each of our meetings and make them available to the public on-line. Today, I would like to start off maybe saying a little bit, but not much, just to make sure that people understand what this is. This is a hand sanitizer, and which is very easy to use. If you either use this or soap, either, it's healthy, and you can keep your loved ones healthy. If you want to find out more information and find out how the city is responding, you can go to the website, sf72.Org. Sf72.Org. So now that I'm all sanitized, we can begin. Madam Clerk, are there any communications? >> Clerk: I have none to report, Mr. President. >> President Yee: okay. Colleagues, today we are approving the minutes from the January 21, 2020 special board meeting and the January 28, 2020 regular meeting. Are there any changes to these meeting minutes? Seeing none, can I have a motion to approve the minutes as presented? Made by supervisor preston and seconded by supervisor mandelman. And then without objection, then, those minutes will be approved after public comment as presented. [Gavel]. >> President Yee: Madam Clerk, please call the consent agenda. >> Clerk: items 1 through 11 are on consent, and these items are considered to be on routine. if a member objects, an item May be removed and considered separately. >> President Yee: okay. Colleagues, would anyone like to sever any of these items from the consent agenda? Seeing none, Madam Clerk, please call the roll. >> Clerk: on items 1 through 11 -- [Roll Call] >> Clerk: there are ten ayes. >> President Yee: without objection, the ordinances are passed, and the resolution is adopted unanimously. [Gavel]. >> President Yee: Madam Clerk, let's go to our regular agenda. Item 12. >> Clerk: item 12 is an item to authorize the director of the department of public health to authorize a cannabis dispenser permittee to operate at a new location under that permit and to affirm the ceqa determination. >> President Yee: Madam Clerk, please call the roll. [Roll Call] >> Clerk: there are eight ayes and two noes, with supervisors stefani and yee in the dissent. >> President Yee: okay. This ordinance is finally passed by an 8-2 vote. Miss Clerk, let's go to new business. Please call item 13. >> item 13 is a resolution taking $13 million and placing it on controller's reserve, subject to the funding of the close of one or more transactions for fiscal year 19-20. >> President Yee: Madam Clerk, please call the roll on that item. >> Clerk: on item 13 -- [Roll Call] >> Clerk: there are ten ayes. >> President Yee: okay. Then without objection, this ordinance is passed on first reading unanimously. [Gavel]. >> President Yee: Madam Clerk, please call the next item. >> Clerk: item 14 is a resolution authorize the director of homelessness and community housing to lease property for one year. >> President Yee: supervisor haney? >> Supervisor Haney: yes. I want to urge my colleagues to support this, and thank abigail stewart from the mayor's office, and the neighboring community for participating in the community process and providing thoughtful, productive feedback. Clearly, we have a huge need to build additional navigation centers and additional navigation center beds, and this areas surrounding 33 gough, which is in district 6, but borders district 5, district 8, and district 9, as well, in need of additional services. The old city building has been an eyesore and has sat vacant for sometime. I also want to thank the budget committee for adopting a commitment to outreach and resources in the neighborhood. I believe this navigation center, with its size and location, presents a unique opportunity to collaborate with local service providers. many of you May have seen some of the recent changes that the department of homelessness and hsoc have been discussing, and now saying in some cases publicly about moving away from a complaint driven system that has used police as first responders to homelessness and has unfortunately struggled to get people into stable housing and services. Instead, what I believe we need is a more intentional model which is led by social workers and trained outreach workers to prioritize people in need. I look forward to continuing to partner with the department of homelessness, the mayor's office to make sure this center succeeds, and of course to approving more centers all over the city in the near future. Thank you. >> President Yee: okay. Colleagues, can we take this item same house, same call? Without objection, this item is adopted unanimously. [Gavel]. >> President Yee: Madam Clerk, please go to the next item. >> Clerk: this is a licenses and service agreement between the city and airport services foundation to extend the services term for services transportation ground fee collection services through March 2023 for an aggregate amount not to exceed 1.7 million and to provide for one two-year renewal option to extend. >> President Yee: colleagues, can we take this same house, same call? Without objection this item is adopted unanimously. [Gavel]. >> President Yee: mad abclerk, call item 19. >> Clerk: item 19 is -- [Inaudible] >> President Yee: Madam Clerk, please call the next item item item item item -- next item. >> Clerk: item 20, a resolution approving the controller's office of public finance debt policy in accordance with california government code, section 8855, and determining other matters in connection therewith. >> President Yee: colleagues, can we take this same house, same call?

Without any objection, then, the vote is rescinded. [Gavel]. >> President Yee: supervisor peskin? >> Supervisor Peskin: thank you, President Yee. Colleagues, last week, as you know, we had this item come before us, and we were concerned that some of these assets that are scheduled to come to the city and county of san francisco to the successor agency, the redevelopment agency, would come at a potential cost. It was my understanding that the department of public works and the city administrator's office were going to propose, although it is not in my possession, long where in we would -- language where in we would sever out a number of streets and sidewalks that would come with liability to the city and county of san francisco and send those back to committee pending a financial workout, and that we would accept the rec and park property alice rogers and mohcd properties including but not limited to the foodco in district 10. I am not in receipt of that legislation, although it was promised to me yesterday by Mr. Spitz of public works. So I would like to make a motion to continue this item to later in the hearing today, and if we receive it, then I would like to introduce those amendments. And if we do not, I would like to make a motion later in today's meeting to continue it to next week. So I would like to make a motion to continue this until later in the meeting, Mr. President. >> President Yee: okay. You don't have to make a motion. I'll just take it out. >> Supervisor Peskin: thank you. >> President Yee: Madam Clerk, item 26. >> Clerk: item 26 is a motion appointing kenneth kim to the street-level drug dealing task force for an indefinite term. >> President Yee: okay. Colleagues, can we take this same house, same call? Without objection, the item is approved unanimously. [Gavel]. >> President Yee: item 27. >> Clerk: 27 is a motion appointing douglas boullard, term ending January 31, 2023, and william barnickel, courtney miller, and hanley chan, terms ending January 31, 2024, to the veteran's affairs commission. >> President Yee: okay. Colleagues, can we take this same house, same call? Without objection, the item is adopted unanimously. [Gavel]. >> President Yee: okay. Madam Clerk, please call the next item. >> Clerk: item 28 is a motion appointing john elberling, misha olivas, raquel redondies, alan manalo, and adam mesnic, terms ending December 1, 2023, to the soma community stabilization fund community advisory committee. >> President Yee: okay. Colleagues, can we take this same house, same call? Without objection, the item is adopted unanimously [Gavel]. >> President Yee: Madam Clerk, can we go to roll call. >> Clerk: supervisor haney? >> Supervisor Haney: overdose deaths increased dramatically from 259 in 2018 to over 330 overdose deaths in 2019. When you break that number down, that's nearly one person a day, which is a massive increase from 2018. That increase is absolutely devastating. Each one of these people are -- had futures that were unnecessarily and needlessly cut short. Loved ones, family, and friends, and we know that lives could have been saved if there were overdose prevention sites that were open. The permitting process that we've created with this legislation is a necessary next step in combatting the opioid crisis. The legislation will allow the city and the department of public health to establish a permitting process for third party nonprofit providers who will be medical professionals to operate a safe injection site as part of the overdose prevention program. What we're proposing is not a radical, new idea. 100 overdose prevention sites operate in cities around the world. No none has experienced an overdose death, and thousands have gained access to services and therapy. In 2017, mayor breed and the department of public health created a task force on addressing the opioid epidemic. The task force's overarching recommendation was to support the safe operation services in san francisco and recommended that the city should open a site. The board of supervisors unanimously passed a resolution that I authored declaring a public health crisis on drug overdoses and drug use. In that resolution, the board directs the department of public -- directed the department of public health to form a plan on that crisis. That plan included the need to open an overdose prevention site, which would be a critical part of a larger strategy to address overdoses in our city. We also need to stream line funding and state support for rapid crisis intervention for people who are in psychosis or at risk of overdose, deploy massive street outreach to help the most vulnerable and coordinate a local, regional, and statewide movement with law enforcement. There was a huge victory in philadelphia that found that overdose prevention sites would not violate criminal law. We also desperately need leadership and support from the state. This is not a time for us to move slowly or delay action. It is going to take all of us using everything we have to address this most deadly crisis and for all of us to work together to save lives. I want to thank mayor breed and her office, all of our community partners that have committed to this work from the safer inside coalition, including lindsey lasalle from the drug policy alliance, laura thomas from the sf aids foundation, by St. Anthony's, the drug users coalition. They save thousands of lives every year, and they should be supported and commended by all of us, and we should listen to them when they tell us that drug overdose sites are the next way to respond to prevent overdoses. I'm also proposing legislation that no tenant in city housing pays more than 30% of their income to rent. Permanent supportive housing is a critical piece of san francisco's homelessness response system. We how's -- house approximately 10,000 formerly homeless residents every overnight, and they're all paying no more than 30% of their income to rent. This has been an intentional and critical policy to ensure that tenants who are working towards more independent living can dedicate some of their income each month to things that they need to get by. The problem is we currently have an inequitable and inconsistent policy for setting rent in permanent supportive housing. Nearly a third of our supportive housing tenants, approximately 3,000 of the most vulnerable tenants of the city, are right hand burdened, paying significantly more of had not already low-incomes to rent. This is a burden that is not imposed by landlords, but imposed by the city and county of san francisco. The buildings for rents are highest not only represent buildings with the most capital needs, they also tend to represent those that house tenants with the highest acuity and most vulnerable. Sometimes these tenants are paying as much as 70 or 80% of their S.S.I. Or general assistance to rents, leaving them with barely anything to get through the month. I hear from many of these tenants in my district who are struggling to afford basic needs. The city should not be taking hundreds of dollars a month out of their pockets which makes it more difficult to afford public transportation and food costs and makes it more likely that they will be back out on the streets. 18% of households in supportive housing received notices of evicts for nonpayment of rent. Unfortunately, funds have not yet been allocated as the mayor's office and department of homelessness have expressed concern that we can maintain services to these clients over time. What has been clear in this process is that we need a single standard. Without such a standard for all units, we will continue to leave thousands of tenants rent burdened by our city, putting them in a position where they cannot afford food, and likely that they will end back in a street. This legislation will set a single level, which we know is the right thing to do, but as of now, we have no plan to actually accomplish it. I want to thank the chair of the budget committee, sandra fewer, for her commitment to ensuring that we spend the $1 million that had been allocated, as well as President Norman yee, who has been a leader to ensure we provide subsidies for seniors and to ensure we keep that rent burden at the 30% level. This is something we will look to in terms of a timeline, and I'm looking forward to working with the mayor and the department of homelessness and all of you to make sure we do this in a fiscally responsible way. This was recommended by the city's S.R.O. Task force, and there was a number of members, including jordan davis and other supportive housing tenants who have been fighting for this proposal. It's the common sense thing to do. It's the right thing to do. Our city should not be creating rent burden for some of the most low-income and rent burdened tenants in our city. Thank you. >> Clerk: thank you, supervisor haney. >> President Yee: so if I talk for ten more seconds, our Madam Clerk will announce our 2:30, then it will become 2:30, and it's going to become official. Madam Clerk, can you announce it. >> Clerk: it's now time for valiant women of the vote and to support women's history month 2020. >> President Yee: okay. Okay. Welcome, everyone, to the chamber for the women's history month celebration. I am excited to be part of this celebration for women's history month and to recognize the efforts of women in our great city. Women's history month is a time to appreciate the contributions of women in our communities who are courageous leaders working to improve the quality of life for san franciscans. Since 1996, the san francisco commission and department on the status of women have recognized the vital work and contributions of women in our local communities through a women's history month program, and I am proud to be part of this celebration. So right now, I would like to welcome department of the status of women director, emily merase to the podium to say a few words about the history of the event. >> Commissioner Murase: good afternoon, President Yee and board of supervisors. Happy women's history month. [Applause] >> Commissioner Murase: it's my great pleasure to welcome you to the annual women's history month celebration. This year, we celebrate the valiant women of the vote. It's very fitting that we celebrate this day on election day in california. I do want to recognize clerk of the board angela calvillo, and my associate director for their very hard work on today's events. I also want to recognize the friends on the commission on status of women represented by linda calhoun and verna lisa cava, on the only department of women's status in the country. Immediately following the board presentation, the friends are hosting a reception for all honorees. We hope you can join us just down the haul in the mayor's conference room 201. As we mark 100 years since the passage of the 19th amendment, it's important to remember that california was the sixth state to ratify the 19th amendment, so we've had a significant role in the narrative of the national women's suffrage movement. Sf treasurer carmen chiu put on a presentation indicating that san francisco was the site of the first ever suffrage March in 1908. We must not forget the suffrage suffragette who over 100 years ago, picketed the white house, went to jail, and endured intense suffering in order to secure the vote. We know that voting matters, it's critically important that this year, 2020, we pay attention to voting rights and voting access, and remind those who can vote to vote. The women being recognized today are dedicated to their neighborhoods, their fields, their communities, to the overall betterment of society through their daily actions, and most importantly, through the power of the vote and encouraging others to exercise their right to vote. Today, supervisors, you'll be highlighting some of the finest individuals working right here in san francisco. Before I conclude, I do want to note that this will be my last women's history month awards ceremony as director of the department on the status of women, as I'll be leaving my position at the end of the month after 15 years of service. i've had the honor to serve former mayor, now governor gavin newsom, mayor ed lee, and now mayor london breed. Now I turn the proceedings back to President Yee and to the board so that you May introduce your women's history month honorees. Thank you. [Applause] >> President Yee: starting off women's history month, we will be honoring our women supervisors, and then starting off in district order. So first up, one of our fierce leaders, supervisor sandra lee fewer, please present your commendation. >> Supervisor Fewer: thank you, present yee. Colleagues, my honoree is someone who I've gotten to know in her wearing many hats not only in the richmond district but others. May I have wendy aragon please come up to the podium. >> thank you, supervisor. [Applause] >> Supervisor Fewer: she has been a san francisco resident since 1996, living in the district since 2008. She became an eligible voter when she turned 18 in 1992, and she has never missed casting a ballot in a political election. At eight years old, she wrote a letter to President Reagan, asking why american factory workers like her father, a union auto worker at the general motors auto plant in fremont, asking why they were losing their jobs. The white house responded by sending her an activity book by fun facts for kids. that is when she knew she was probably meant to be a democrat. Wendy continues to make waves and continued to make her voice heard as a scholar activist. When she was a teen, she went before the school board to protest cancellation of classes. She befriended a late california senator, who she credits for shaping her progressive values and activism. She walked the halls of the capitol with him to fight for the education system. She worked to overturn proposition 8 and don't ask, don't tell, passed affordable care act, fight for the dream act and daca, and ensured that democrats were elected to every congressional seat in 2010. Wendy has always put her heart in electing candidates from the bottom of the ballot to the top. She is the tireless volunteer who's willing to knock on doors, make phone calls, and talk to voters at farmers markets. She invested her heart and soul into her candidates. She goes on all in. Since 2009, wendy has been committed to building electoral power in the richmond district, something I am fond of. Between 2013 and 2016, she served as the President Of the richmond district democratic club, where she ushered in a new generation of members and leaders. She will be returning to that role again this year because she knows that the stakes are too high not to fight for the heart and soul of our city, our district, and our nation. Wendy is also a one richmond hero. As I have spoken about many times when we have initiatives in the richmond district, in the richmond, we are ininclusive, inclusive, in the richmond, we take care of each other, in the richmond, we shop and eat local. I am proud to call wendy not only my constituent, but my friend, and I am honored today to recognize her in women's history month. [Applause] >> thank you, supervisor fewer. I'm humbled to receive this award. I was to acknowledge the value went -- I want to acknowledge the valiant women who put their lives on the line so that I can vote. Suffrage I am the proud mexican american granddaughter of both mexican immigrants and of mexican nationals living on mexican and indigenous land in new mexico long before it became a U.S. State or territory. However, despite being unborn and naturalized in this country, my great grandmothers and grandmothers were subjected to things such as literacy tests, language barriers, poll taxes, proving their citizenship and white supremacist ballot. Every time I knock on a door, every time I cast my right to vote, I have a great privilege knowing that the women who came before me in my family did not always have. I also want to give a shoutout to one of my heros, jovita jovita nadar. She was one of the first people who organized a militant democratic socialist movement. I stand on these amazing women's shoulders every day, and I won't forget that. [Speaking spanish language] [Applause] >> Clerk: Mr. President, while they are taking their camera shot, I'll just remind to the future honorees in chambers this afternoon, we really want to hear your statement about how valiant the vote has been over the years, but if you could section any electioneering in the chamber from your statement because it is election day, that would be great. Thank you kindly. >> President Yee: okay. Next up is our other fierce warrior from the board of supervisors, supervisor hillary ronen. >> Supervisor Ronen: I am so excited about this. Nicolle jermaine, where are you? Come on up. [Applause] >> Supervisor Ronen: it is my pleasure and my excitement to be honoring today nicolle tremini jermaine, the mother of the portola library for women's history. Nicolle grew up in new jersey surrounded by books and thanks her mother for cultivating a love of reading. Not allowed to watch any T.V., nicolle spent hours as a child visiting the library and hosting story time for anyone who would listen, including her stuffed animals. At 16, nicolle decided to spread her wings and move to california to live with her dad and santa cruz became her home. In 1993, while in college, she became a page at the S.F. Main library, and she never looked back. She knew it was her destiny. Quoted in the dewey decimal in an article in 2002, nicolle called herself a new librarian of the 21 century, explaining that the role of librarian needed to shift dramatically in today's world of information to being an information specialist. In 2003, after ten years working as a library page, nicolle became the portola branch's children's librarian. Nicolle believes that everything in order to encourage kids to love libraries, nicolle believes in a restoreative justice policy, working with kids so they always feel welcome. When a bilingual third grader told her I love this library, and I never want to leave, she knew she found her calling. She is a founding member of the portola green and steering committee, whose mission is to promote portola's district identity by building a more green and sustainable future, she helped build the first garden in 2014. Not only does the seed library teach kids about the history of the garden district identity, but it also teaches them about nutrition and food security and makes the library more of a community space. When she's not devoting her time to her adopted family in the portola library, and her own family, she advocates for her employees on the bargaining team, believing that happy employees are valuable employees. From all of us in district 9 and especially the portola community, congratulations for being by far the coolest librarian in town. We love you. [Applause] >> thank you so much, hillary. Thank you to you and your team. And hello to everyone here today. Thank you for being here. I think hillary said it all, and yes, I feel so lucky to be honored for doing something I absolutely love doing. I do put my heart and soul into everything I do he portola branch library for the youth and everyone of other ages, too, but I do focus on youth. It's true. I do see libraries -- in these dark times, I think we need a lot more light, and I see libraries and each of us being the light to guide us to doing whatever we need help with. You name it, we've got it all at the library. I have done it nearly 30 years. I have committed myself, I have been dedicated to the people of san francisco and anyone else who May wander into the branch, and I will continue to do so for as long as I am able. And again, I feel also, there's a lot of gratitude. gratitude is always the attitude, right? I am quite grateful that I have the opportunity to serve people every day in this way. I have this opportunity every day to help people make their lives better, you know, to help youth understand that they're -- you know, everything is not happening on the screen. There's real life out there, there's books. And that's right, I am a self-proclaimed book pusher and screen diverter, because I think we need to bring up a society of humans rather than drones, right? So I will continue to try humanizing the world as much as possible. As we always say, all are welcome, all are welcome. The light is always on at every single library. I treat you all like you're my houseguests, and welcome. Come to my house. [Applause] >> President Yee: okay. Our next supervisor to present will be supervisor stefani. >> Supervisor Stefani: thank you, President Yee. Can I please have andrea ducele come to the podium. Colleagues, in honor of women's history month, I am absolutely thrilled to honor someone who's voice has been heard for more than a decade now, my friend, andrea ducele. Women dive into policy, we collaborate with others, and we are forceful advocates for our community and of course for our children. For too long, however, women's voices have been absolutely underrepresented in politics and governments and, of course, corporate board rooms and a whole bunch of other places, but that gap is closing thanks to women like andrea. According to the reflective democracy campaign, for example, in 2015, only 17% of elected prosecutors were women, while 83% were men. And as of last year, 24% of elected prosecutors were women while 76% were men. So this matters not only because of women's vast underrepresentation in shaping our criminal justice system but because of how emerge started. In 2002, a friend of andrea's told her he had they had decided to run for the district attorney of san francisco. Andrea sat her friend down, made her type up a biography and navigate the information into a database, all part of emerge. She realized if this incredible woman was having a hard time on finding information on how to run for office, then I'm quite sure other women were also facing similar challenges that kept them from running in the first place. So that year, in 2002, andrea and a group of friends started emerge california to recruit and train democratic women in the bay area to run for office. In 2005, andrea created emerge america to replicate emerge california's successes across the country, and 15 years later, emerge has training programs in 29 states. During this time, 4,000 women have trained to run for office, and over 1,000 have won their elections, and over 500, including myself, mayor london breed, and former supervisor and board of equalisation chair currently serve thanks to emerge california. In a testament to andrea's mentorship, her friend, who decided to run for district attorney in 2002, is now the second black woman ever to serve in the united states senate. I think we all know who I'm talking about, senator kamala harris. As andrea has said, this isn't a pink wave that will crash and die, it's a powerful movement, one that we've been building and nurturing for more than 15 years. And I say this, it's going to continue to grow because I see it in women all the time. Today for our celebration of women's history month, I could not imagine another honoree than andrea due steel. Thank you, andrea, for your commitment, your work, and your friendship. [Applause] >> first, I want to say thank you, supervisor, for the honor to be here today. My fellow honorees, I want to congratulate my friend emily merase for her amazing service. Emily is also an emerge graduate, and just thank you so much for all you do. I want to say in addition to being inspired by my friend who wanted to run for district attorney, I also was unspired in 2002 when I -- was inspired in 2002 when I sat at my computer and pulled up my board of supervisors and saw there were only two board of supervisors. I'm actually a native floridian, and I thought wow, I moved here, and I thought this was a progressive place. Today, we have three women, and I want to tell you we always have to keep fighting. We work really hard, and our numbers go up, and then our numbers go down. It's very much like civil rights. It's just a constant fight we have to wage, and we have to encourage people to have a gender lens when voting. I don't know about you, but I think we need to have at least 50/50 if we're talking about a city like san francisco. And I'm very passionate about that, and I know the subject is also on voting. And I just can't help by think about my mother today. She was an immigrant with a fourth-grade education. And I remember asking her at one point about voting. You know, how you never ask your family members anything until you're older. And I said well, do you vote? I mean, do you vote in elections? She said she only voted once in her life. It was for john f. Kennedy. Just a reminder, a lot of people don't vote because they don't think their vote matters or the system is relevant to them. I'm so lucky that I can participate in the political process not just in voting but in trying to build a more reflective democracy for us all. So thank you so much for inviting me here, and I hope you'll join me in continuing this fight to have a more beautiful, reflective democracy. Thank you. [Applause] >> President Yee: okay. That will be the end of our women presentations, and sadly, there's only three of them out of 11. Hopefully in the future we'll see those numbers go back up or will be on equal footing with my male colleagues on the board of supervisors. So next up is supervisor safai. >> Supervisor Safai: >> colleagues, I am so happy to be here when we gather for women and get out the vote. Today, I'd like to celebrate the work and bright future of hang mei peng. [Applause] >> Supervisor Safai: all right. Hong mei was born in singapore and migrated to the united states with her family when she was in her teens. Her employer was a fraudulent employer who left them without immigration papers when they settled here. Poverty, language barriers and cultural barriers, she was able to form meaningful relationships with her participation in forensic debate. There, she honed her public speaking skills, increased her confidence, and her ability to connect with an audience. she was elected by her peers to serve on the baltimore city student commission as a commissioner before graduating from high school and became -- and becoming the first in her family to attend college at the new school in new york city. At new school, hang mei cultivated her passion for social justice through the urban studies program. After graduation, she continued to mentor and coach high school students in competitive forensics debate, grassroots activism, and policy advocacy. Hang mei got her start in politics in new york city where she cofounded in organizing raise which stands for raising asian immigrant stories on the east coast. The program kick started after daca was announced and provided undocumented A.P.I. Youth a safe space to build community and advocate for immigration reform. Hang mei was able to benefit from the obama era daca program and was finally able to adjust her immigration status. She led base building efforts to connect other undocumented A.P.I.S to raise membership, and lobbied congress for humane, comprehensive immigration reform as recently as 2013. Hang mei moved to san francisco shortly after that in 2014 due to its history of social movement and opportunity to mobilize and organize among the A.P.I. Community here in san francisco and its long history of activism. She worked at asian americans advocating justice, A.P.I., where she spear headed the first undocumented A.P.I. Program in the country. She base built, mentored, and led freedom campaigns for A.P.I. Women who survived domestic violence, unjust incarcerations and those subject to immigration deportation. Hang mei is during the director at a civil rights community organization committed to defending civil rights of asian americans and chinese americans and advance multiracial democracy. She joined the immigration rights program in 2016, and in her current role, she has worked with public private media and community stakeholders to advance an inclusive civil rights agenda in san francisco. Some of her most recent projects include partnering with immigrant rights coalition to improve san francisco's 24-7 network for immigrants who are targets of trump's immigrant policies. Protecting equal access to services for legal and nonlegal immigrants in partnership with san francisco language access network, and also advocating for a more inclusive citywide project labor agreement that is accessible to communities of color and immigrants to secure economic opportunities for all the workers in san francisco. She's made many positive changes in such a short amount of time here in san francisco, and we've all truly benefited from her advocacy and hard work. Hang mei, when I thought about who to honor today, I couldn't think of anyone better that I wanted to highlight. I work with you personally on the citywide P.L.A. You never were flustered, you knew how to push the information forward. Whenever I had questions on immigration and I am reform, you're one of the people I think of. So today, all the work that you've done and your dedication, I'm truly honored to honor you as one of the valiant women of the vote. [Applause] >> thank you, supervisor safai. Good afternoon to you and happy super tuesday. I really appreciate the supervisor's commendation and for your support on all of the key initiatives that we have been working on in the last few years. I am so humbled to be recognized today alongside such a powerful cohort of women, and it has been an absolute privilege to serve the community here in san francisco and to have been able to work with all of you on the board. I just wanted to take this opportunity to express my thanks to President Yee, supervisors fewer, ronen, mandelman, and yee for champion championing immigrants rights access. I want to thank supervisor mar and yee for working with us, for supervisor haney to ensure that good jobs are available to all in san francisco, and supervisor fewer, for your decades of service to those in the san francisco chinese community. Justice requires structural systemic and institutional efforts. Justice requires personal courage and our collective political imaginations. In addition to my work at C.A.A., I long to transform the status quo in a world where we uphold the virtues of the ohlone people whose land we stand on so no one knows the fear and anxiety of being displaced, a world where women, nongender and non-binary people feel safe of walk being the streets, where cages are not a part of our lexicon, and where young people do not question whether our bodies are our own. It is unlikely that a world like that will happen overnight, but I'm hopeful that we can build this together by addressing the needs of those most directly impacted by our public policies. I want to express my personal gratitude to my mom, who's her today, for her gift of magic that is life. I want to thank bethany lee, who brought me into this work back in new york city, and for teaching me never to settle for what is less than whole, and to the C.A.A. Family who is here today for their trust and guidance and for allowing me to shepherd the organization's progressive agenda here in san francisco, to annette wong and all of the C.A.A. Staff for their camaraderie and who serve the most vulnerable in our communities day in and day out. For all the women who lead and inspire change every day and for the valiant warriors in our community who teach us to be brave, resilient, and continue the fight each day. Thank you to you, supervisor safai, and I look forward to continuing the fight onward and upward. [Applause] >> President Yee: thank you. Next up will be supervisor walton. >> Supervisor Walton: thank you, President Yee. Good afternoon, everyone in the chambers. At this time, I rise to honor a long time community activist, community leader, and someone who I have had the opportunity to look up to for several years, Miss Carol tatum. [Applause] >> Supervisor Walton: Miss Carol tatum has been in the forefront of advocacy for the bayview-hunters point community for more than 50 years, although you cannot tell by looking at her. Miss Tatum came to san francisco in 1955 from mobile, alabama, attended dames dinman middle school, city college of san francisco, and san francisco state university. In the 60s, she began a long career in advocacy, working as t wapac, the san francisco redevelopment agency as it changed the fillmore district to what it is today, the western addition. As the administrator at wapac, carol helped residents to decipher the rapid and disdeserting changes that displace far too many residences and businesses. Miss Tatum also worked with the bayview-hunters point foundation where she cofounded and became the director of an outpatient alcoholism prevention program treatment program designed to specifically address issues of alcohol use for african americans and their families. The agency did pioneering works in breaking barriers, dispelling myths. Additionally, the excessive number of liquor stores on third street and their aggressive advertising practices led Miss Tatum to form the third street alcohol and tobacco task force to reduce the harmful effects of tobacco and alcohol. The task force addressed disproportionate alcohol and tobacco advertising and business practices that targeted children, youth, and women, and led to loitering. Miss Tatum also became a proud member of the coalition whose organizing efforts resulted in the 1995 ordinance that prohibits smoking in public places in san francisco, a practice that spread across the nation in airplanes, buses, trains, etc. As a consultant, she developed programs designed to teach women the problems that alcohol and tobacco use can bring. In the 90s, as executive director of young community developers, she continued her passion of service by planning, developing, implementing employment training for young people. At the recreation and park department, it was Miss Carol tatum who coordinated the community decision to build a new martin luther king swimming pool. Her spirit of volunteerism and public service has led her to serve on a variety of councils, including the national black alcoholism council, american heart association, heart in the black community, the bayview uniters point roundtable, citywide leadership forum, black women organized for action, served as executive committee member of the national advancement of colored people, naacp here in san francisco, and a trustee of providence baptist church. Retired from employment since 2000, she is active as a volunteer. She has strived throughout her life to improve the quality of life for others and believes that has contributed to her own quality of life. We are privileged to honor Miss Carol tatum here in the board of supervisors chamber. Miss Tatum? [Applause] >> I want to say good afternoon to everyone, Mr. President, board members, friends, family, colleagues, city and county of san francisco and beyond, and to Mr. Walton -- supervisor walton. I guess when you've been around as long as I have, you have the pleasure and the opportunity of seeing people grow up. And so before us today is supervisor walton. And I want to tell you, I was quite humbled when he told me I was going to be honored, and I stand here with tremendous humility and gratitude. and so people ask me frequently, well, how old are you? And so I say, I am closer to 80 than I am 70. Now you figure it out. But as Mr. Walton said -- supervisor walton said, I came here from mobile, alabama in 1955. I remember when I was about eight, and I had lived in an insulated and nurtured african american environment. We went to segregated schools, we had our own transportation, and I believe the only thing we brought from the store was maybe some flour because we had our own farm, and we produced just about everything. And that was in the country. And then, I went back to mobile, and my aunt was taking me somewhere with her. We got on the bus, and I jumped up and sat in the first seat that I saw, and everything stopped and stood still. I remember my aunt's hand being suspended with the fear. I remember seeing the black people standstill. I remember white people be still, and the bus driver, who was quite a big guy, got up, came over to me, and said, with the n-word, go to the back of the bus. So I didn't know what to do, I didn't know what I had done. And my aunt said, come on, carol, let's get off this bus because I don't want to have to kill this man. And she had a knife. And so we got off the bus. But I felt bad because we had to walk, and it was quite a long walk, but I remember that very vividly. And then, we got to san francisco. And you hear about california, and you think palm trees, and you think sunshine, and you think lemon groves, and the like. Well, we got to san francisco, and it was very, very hot in alabama. But when we got here, it was cold. It was July, and my father loved san francisco. I knew we weren't going back. But we lived off monterey boulevard, and it was referred to as the n-hill where we lived in san francisco. At some point, we moved to hunters point, and I had grownup a little bit, and I had gotten a job, and I came home, and there were tanks all up and down third street because some riots had broken up in another part of the country, and another young man had been shot and killed. And so the young men were protesting. I guess they thought the protests were going to get out of hand, so they sent tanks. I remember thinking to myself, how am I going to get home? How am I going to get from third street to up on the hill? So those are some of my earliest memories. But when I went to work for wapac in the western addition, and I saw what was urban renewal, but what was really african american removal from this city, that's when it began. But in '55, there had been the protests protests on venice avenue. So those were a few of the experiences in my city. And then, when I went to work, as I said, little old people would come in, and they'd have pieces of paper, and they would be shaking, and it was something that they had been given that was supposedly a certificate that would bring them back into the stow. Well, -- city. Well, you know we know that that did not happen. So then, I went to work on the other side of the city, and it was a time of hope and planning and model cities. That's what we thought would happen. Well, out of that, there was someone in this room who was a part of that, Mr. Claude everhart. Did he leave? Mr. Claude everhart was a part of all that activity. And I worked with the likes of Miss Mary rogers, Miss Miss eloise kennedy, eileen hernandez, and I could go on and on. But I had the privilege and the great honor of working with and learning from those women. And so I could stand here, and you can say, I could go on -- and I will stop. I will say this, that reparations -- yes. We need reparations in san francisco. 80% of the 3% of african americans who live in this city live in public housing. So that tells you something about the health, it tells you about economics, employment, and so on. 80% of african americans in the city. I watched this percentage of african americans in the city decrease from 18 to 3%. That was a -- that is a void. I don't believe that we are going to bring people back. I'm going to say that, and I am an eternal optimist. I know that character builds hope, and hope springs eternal. I support mayor london breed. I had the privilege of watching her grow up. When I met her, she was just out of college we know that as a people, by working together with other people, we can make some accomplishments, we can make some times, we can have some successes. But you are in a position of power. You are the policy makers in this city, and I ask you, when you would like decisions, you would put yourself in my place, that you would put yourself in the position of 80% of african americans who are in low and subsidized housing and think about their quality of life. Thank you thank you -- thank you. >> President Yee: so if we could quietly leave the room, if you're going to leave the room. I want to bring up my next supervisor from district 8, supervisor mandelman. >> Supervisor Mandelman: thank you, President Yee. Happy women's her-story month, everyone. Hello, theresa kolish. As we acknowledge and celebrate this 100th anniversary year of the 19th amendment, I will say that as a gay man, I am profoundly grateful for that 100 years of women dreaming big and fighting hard, electioneering at the ballot box, city halls, in neighborhoods, and maybe soon at the white house. Friends and colleagues, I'm so honored to honor theresa kolish. She has lived around the corner from glen canyon for ten years, where she lives with her husband and has raised her two kids. Theresa and more than 2,000 volunteers in sister district san francisco get out the message. Nationally, sister district project volunteers have raised $1.1 million, mailed 313,000 postcards, made 242,000 phone calls, and knocked on 78,000 doors. Theresa is also the cofounder of vote like a woman, launched in commemoration of the 19 amendment which gets women to vote in swing states that are critical to winning the electoral college. Theresa, I'm proud to call you my constituent and my friend. Thank you for all you do to keep the history of the sufficient suffrage suffragettes 100 years later, and for turning states from red to blue. >> thank you, raphael. It's so great to be here. Sister districts, it is an amazing group of people who have come together. I am so proud to be raising my family in san francisco, and in particular, district 8 of course. Why I'm so proud to be here, when we look down our ballots, we're basically choosing different shades of blue. Our goal at the sister district project which was started here in san francisco in that lovely bar in the mission called keith's, and then, in 2016, and then, the sister district san francisco chapter launched in the early months of 2016. We are trying to make sure that our friends and family in those states have their voices heard again. So as raphael said, we are supporting strategic campaigns and flipping seats, and our efforts contributed greatly to virginia now being a blue trifecta as of 2019. [Applause] >> we hope that 2010 will continue to be a banner year, and also, as raphael mentioned, to ensure we have more voter participation, myself and a group of like minded women here in san francisco have launched -- well, it's actually launching on sunday, international women's day, the vote like a woman campaign, which is designed to get women registered and pledging to vote one person at a time in these strategic states. And our goal is to make sure that the 20 -- the 100th anniversary of the 19 amendment in August 2020 is celebrated appropriately with all those women turning out in November November to take back our country. So if you're interested, look for votelikeawoman.Com and the sister district project. Thank you so much. [Applause] >> President Yee: okay. Thank you. So my honoree is christine ribold, and thanks for being here, and come up to the podium. Christine? [Applause] >> President Yee: this year's theme for women's history month is valiant women of the vote. Today, we're hard at work at our businesses and with our families. Christine is someone who has embodied what it means to become a community and neighborhood leader and advocate. What started as a vision zero pedestrian safety grant through my participatory budgeting program in 2017 as manifest -- has manifested into her becoming a neighborhood leader in sunnyside. Christine's budgeting proposal received more than 650 votes from district 7 residents, and when the project is complete, it will result in speed cushions, continental cross ways and A.D.A. Circular ramps on jetson and genessee. Christine designed a postcard to name all the proposals. The apology following year, christine took engauging with her community to a new level. She worked with her neighbors and community involvement going door to door with friends of the havalock bridge group. This was far more complicated than even the city had anticipated. multiple departments have overlapping jurisdiction, including pacific -- public works, M.T.A., P.U.C., caltrans, B.A.R.T., city college, rec and park, and even sfpd. Thus, the complication of a single bridge. In speaking with departments that have worked with her, they say that christine is very adept to working with a massive diversity of stakeholders in her neighborhood to solve problems. Public works share that she is one of the most creative problem solvers that they have ever worked with because she understands that collaboration is key in problem solving. She kristina applies her love for her neighborhood, community organizing, and graphic design skills in a persistent way that allows here her -- her to navigate complex bureaucratic communities with ease. In her professional life, she has been -- she has amazing talent as a grachk designer who works with a variety of media, including digital, painting, and print making. Her work tends to focus on business with a cause, including san francisco casa, casa standing for court appointed appointed special advocates, and also the people wine revolution of sasoon valley. I am honored to recognize christine, not only a true leader in my district, sunnyside, but also throughout san francisco. this is my honoree of san francisco women's history month, christine. [Applause] >> I feel truly honored to have my small contribution to my tiny corner of the city recognized thank recognized. Thank you to all of you. [Inaudible] >> -- spans I-280 between city college and menlo park. So it connects neighborhoods, parks, transits and schools in an area with -- [Please stand by] . >> as someone who works in public spaces, I have had firsthand experience navigating the concerns of residents around the issue of >> all right -- >> President Yee: all right. Next up will be our supervisor from district 6, supervisor haney. >> Supervisor Haney: thank you, President Yee, and I first want to congratulate all of the honorees for all of your work and to also thank my former colleague, director emily mer asee and the -- merase and all their work, as well. Today, I have the honor of nominating an amazing powerful educator and leader in our community, wendy click. [Cheers and Applause] >> Supervisor Haney: that's wendy's face on there. One thing you'll know about wendy is she always rolls with a crew. So I want to welcome wendy's crew here, as well, and all the folks from hospitality house. wendy is someone who has dedicated her life to educating and empowering others, to restorative justice, and to empowering disenfranchised voters and communities. Everyone who lives or works in the tenderloin knows wendy. It seems like half of them are here today. She wears many hats and runs in many circles, but one thing we know about wendy is when there is a fight for justice in our community, she's there. Wendy has dedicated her life to serving san francisco's tenderloin, midmarket, and sixth street communities. She has fought against prison privatization, she has fought for tenant rights, and she currently serves as the deputy director of initiatives for hospitality house where she is responsible for supporting the company's leadership team and leading system change efforts, especially in the justice system. But wendy actually has a very long history of justice work, some of which I've learned about in preparation for today. She served as the program coordinate coordinator for the california coalition of justice reforms that challenges the institutional violence imposed on the women, transgender people, and communities of color by the prison industrial complex. She also helped organize the freedom rally to end the california women's prison crisis in 2012. Wendy was formerly incarcerated herself and has worked inside prison walls to help inspire hope and the possibility of a better future. Upon her release from valley state prison for women, wendy joined thousands of formerly incarcerated people and their families to end the prison and jail expansion that has devastated california communities. As hospitality house, wendy has worked tirelessly to end the criminalization of california's working class communities, extend parole for sick and elderly people, and implement alternative justices instead of imprisonment. A more recent project of wendy has been the walk with wendy mobilization that happens on every single election day or around election time, and I was actually able to participate in the walk with wendy during the -- the first walk and the first walk where you were able to vote for the first time. [Applause] >> Supervisor Haney: and it was absolutely one of the most inspiring things that I've been able to witness. Hundreds of people from our community coming together, you know, six different languages being spoken, people from all over the place all coming to join you in solidarity and carrying their ballots to city hall. This was absolutely I think reflective of your leadership and the example that you've set. I also want to note on election day that there are still close to 50,000 people in our state who are unable to vote because they are currently on parole, and this is an absolute injustice, and I know it's one that you've brought attention to, and you've fought against. And not just for people who were formerly incarcerated, but for all of the folks in our community who often feel like they don't have a voice, who May be unsure whether they should show up and vote at all. You've been a model and a leader and a shining light for us, all of us, and I see that every day, and I certainly -- when I thought about who to honor on election day, you were absolutely the first person who came to behind, so thank you, wendy. >> thank you. >> Supervisor Haney: I'm so happy to honor you. Thank you for all that you do. >> thank you. [Cheers and Applause] >> I just want to say I am truly honored, and thank you, supervisor haney, for honoring me. As you can tell, some of of the folks in the room have walk with wendy shirts. This is giving education to folks who want to vote but they don't know how to vote. Just come on down to 290 turk, and I'll help you out, I promise. [Applause] >> as you were speaking, I was thinking about the struggle. Who in the world would have thought that a person from a small town in oklahoma, population 400, would be here today, being honored in san francisco. [Applause] >> I came to california because you know the beverly hillbillies said it was the place to be? I served 18 years of a life sentence. Every day in that institution, I said, when I get out, I am going to empower somebody, not just to get out, when you want your dream job or dream anything. Look at me. I'm here to say I spent 18 years in prison, and I am in the tenderloin every single day trying to bring empowerment to people, not just to vote, but to be themselves. And those folks, the women that are on the streets, unhoused. Come on down to turk street, and we've got some fresh water with lemon and cucumbers, and you can just hangout. I have to say, matt, when you called me last week, I thought it was to tell me you missed walk with wendy. I didn't know it was something better. Thank you so much, matt. [Cheers and Applause] >> President Yee: okay. Thank you. Next up will be supervisor with district 5, supervisor preston. >> thank you, President Yee and colleagues, and congratulations to all the folks who came down today to show your support for these amazing leaders. In honor of women's history month, I am very pleased today to honor one of our most incredible community leaders in district 5, kristin evans. [Applause] >> Supervisor Preston: kristin was born in washington, and i believe both her parents May be here today. Her father went onto work at an aluminum company that he continues to work for to this day. Because of that, kristin moved around the country and the globe. Kristin studied political science at vassar in new york. After college, in the midst of a recession, submitted over 100 resumes to various companies before landing a job at an H.R. Consulting firm where she was tasked with analyzing executive pay, and I'm guessing that that led to her later focus on income inequality issues. In 2001, she received her M.B.A. From the university of michigan and landed a job at a management consulting firm, where she worked with numerous tech clients, and there, she met her husband, praveen, and a few years later, they both decided they wanted a change from their careers where they had both been successful at. They came back to the bay area, settling in the haight-ashbury. In 2008, they took over the book smith at a time when amazon had already taken over one-third of book sales. And yet, they remained determined to maintain a successful community cancered book store in the internet era, and they've -- community centered book store in the internet era, and in the years since, they've done just that. Together with her dog, the famous joey pistachio, who is with us here today, christine has earned the title of mayor of haight. kristin is incredibly human minded when it comes to the role she plays a a business owner. In order to educate business owners, she held a talk at the book smith about the causes and potential solutions for homelessness. She also has a policy in her store that any of her employees can get a pay advance as an interest free loan of up to 20% of their annual wages for unexpected expenses. She has tirelessly advocated for merchants in the haight and beyond at a time when businesses across the district and san francisco are struggling. She's served on the board of the haight-ashbury business association since 2011, when it was founded, and she's served as the President Of the foundation since 2017. She's also been on the board of the haight-ashbury neighborhood council since 2014. In 2018, christine was asked by the coalition on homelessness to be an official proponent of proposition c, the visionary tax on the highest earning companies in san francisco to fund solutions to homelessness. As a business owner, kristin quickly became one of the faces most identified with the measure, speaking out on the challenges facing our city's homeless population. She rallied her neighborhood into action, bringing together the haight-ashbury neighborhood association, the haight-ashbury merchant association and neighbors to collect signatures to qualify for the ballot. What began as a grassroots organization was transformed between kristin and salesforce C.E.O. Mark bennioff. Benioff was compelled to give the small amount of $7 million to the organization due to kristin's advocacy. In honor of women's history month, we recognize kristin evans for her passion, her tireless commitment, her sheer brilliance, and her ability to embrace transformative change and register voters. On behalf of the entire board of supervisors, it's my pleasure to give you this award today. >> President Yee: so before you speak, supervisor peskin would like to say a few words. >> Supervisor Peskin: thank you, President Yee. I'm so sorry to elongate this presentation, but I wanted to join with supervisor preston. I'm not advocating on March the 3 for anything that May be on the ballot work, but the policy work that Miss Evans be has done in and around of advancing the issues of vacancy in neighborhood districts has been profoundly important, and I just want to thank you for that. [Applause] >> thank you very much. Because we're here for women's history month, I asked my mom to come with me because I'm a relatively newcomer to politics in a sense. Yes, I've been involved in my community as a business owner and as a representative in the merchants association and the neighborhood council, but really, it's more recent that I have been ak ctivated to become more involved in politics. That is due to my mom, who, when I was growing up, she would tell me she felt she had limited career options when she came out of -- career choices when she came out of college, what her options were. She encouraged me not necessarily to cook for myself, so I didn't get that skill set until later. But through her strong sense of women's equality, she really instilled in me my need to be my own person. I remember coming back from dinner conversations with my dad's work colleagues, saying I really skewered them over that. It was when our current President Was elected that our whole family became much more engaged in politics. My mom and my sister and I all participated in the women's March, and my mom volunteered for hillary clinton's campaign. And I guess I can say we're making some progress because today, we voted for two different women for President. So maybe, you know, mom said she'd love to have a woman President Before she dies. I hope that's going to happen. It May not happen this November, but I do hope that we will continue to see strides and representation in our political office. Thank you. I did want to recognize, also, just other women who have influenced me, including my grandmothers who are no longer with us. my grandmother, frances evans, was a teacher and taught journalism and krisk journalism and civics. My other grandmother never had the chance to go to college, but she was a strong woman leader and was a pilot at one point. Through my advocacy here in the city, when jennifer 23rd friedenbach asked me to come work with her for the homeless and their problems. I more recently have had the opportunity to work with hope williams and gloria berry and these are the women that I feel are the next generation that will become the next tier of leaders, women leaders that I hope will be taking all the seats in this room. Thank you very much. [Applause] >> President Yee: thank you. So our next person is our supervisor from district 4, supervisor mar. >> Supervisor Mar: thank you, President Yee. Continuing this wonderful super tuesday celebration of women's history month and our theme of valiant women of the vote, I'm so excited to have the opportunity of honoring another amazing women who embodies that idea, susan pheifer. A lot of people here know her already, I want to tell you a little bit about her. She retired in 2013 from cal performances at U.C. Berkeley. After retirement, she noticed a need in her neighborhood to have a space in community for discussing issues of importance, and as susan often does, she founded the outer sunset park side resident association. A lifelong democrat, she has been a delegate to the democratic convention since 2008, as well as an elected delegate to the 20010, 2012, and 2016 democratic convention. In 2018, with our first opportunity to go back to the ballot and defend our democracy since trump took off, susan stepped up and managed a team of volunteers in making hundreds of thousands of calls and texts to voters in swing districts across the country. With susan's leadership, red to blue S.F. Helped sin 16 out 19 -- win 16 out of the 19 districts in her party, helping to make nancy pelosi once again speaker of the house. As we choose a nominee to take back the white house, susan is working with pelosi and the democratic san francisco party to take back the senate, keep the house blue in 2020. With you but every month, she leads a group of volunteers in the naturalization ceremonies, registering a group of 350 to 400 citizens to vote. They leave as citizens, newly registered voters, and newly empowered to express their voice and their vote. Thank you, susan, for all you do for the sunset district and democracy. From organizing in approximate our neighborhoods to organizing in neighborhoods across the country. We're so grateful for your work ethic, vision, and leadership. Thank you so much. [Applause] >> thank you. Thank you, gordon. Actually, gordon, I think has benefited from something we did with ospra. In 2018, I retired, and I discovered discovered nextdoor.Com. I discovered that parkside was a next door neighborhood, and I discovered there were issues with car break ins and burglaries and etc., so I made up the outer sunset association, and created a name that you could announce. In 2018, when I was running the red to blue office, we had the first open supervisor race in district 4 in a long time, and there were, I think, seven people that signed up. I decided there needed to be forums where people could hear all of them together, so I stupidly scheduled three forums while I was running the red to blue office and somehow was able to do it, and we had several hundred people turn out to hear those, and we thought it was productive, so I was proud to do that. I was running my locket. This was my mother's baby locket that she gave to me shortly before she passed away, and I never take it off. She was my mentor. She had a high school education, but knowledge stopped her, and she loved politics. And I used to go with her to vote when I was a kid when they had the machines with the levers that you'd pull. That instilled in me the love to vote as a person, which i still do. A few years ago, I inherited a project -- many of you May remember richard and shirley hansen. They were members of the richmond democratic club. They started doing the naturalization ceremonies when they were at the masonic auditorium. The masonic had a dispute with a concert promoter that came in and said they couldn't do that during the day, so they got moved to the paramount theater in oakland. Right after I retired in 2013, the first time I did was go register people to vote at the paramount with them, including the man who was the executive director at cal performances at the time who became naturalized a month after I started doing. They retired, and I took it on and built it out to where we have six ironing boards, three on each side. In 2016, the volunteer board really grew, and I want to thank theresa and sister district and the people of swing list who recruit volunteers for me every month. We get 30 to 40 people who come over every month for each swearing in ceremony. I have a hard-and-fast rule. We do not influence what party they register for. We're in the free speech area. Hard fast rule, I want people to vote the way 24e79 they want, and want want -- way they want, and when they came out, you'll hear me shout. Finish the job. once you become a citizen, you register to vote. I love to see the excitement when we empower them to do what we've been waiting for, so I want to thank you for giving me this honor. I really appreciate it. [Applause] [Please stand by] >> the earlier comment supervisor walton's honoree talked about with un-american committee and all the things you saw Ms. Williams' family was a part of and she has associations around the world in south africa, india, and indonesia and she's been a fighter for justice starting in high school with solidarity movements particularly through the neat nam -- vietnam war and start the year before I was born. I will not tell you the year. She has been quoted in the new york times around she wrote for the paper and earned her degree in journalism. Though her focus now is on the middle east because of the wars our country has been provoking and fighting there she continues to work on vete flam and for veterans that she always reminds me on the street in e-mails along with the rest of the neighborhood. One of her biggest accomplishments was helping raise more than and this is a huge amount of money even for those of us who run for office, $300,000 for vietnamese victims of the war there who still suffer effects of agent orange and serves the san francisco veterans for peace. in recent years nadia has been a tireless supporter of political causes which is not why I have her here today but phone banks local issues and I'm not advocating anything but including the tax on the ballot and in addition to community efforts she's raised her family, I know her family and she has three kids, six grandchildren and her kids are union organizers and her daughters are active in environmental issues in northern california. Nadia, you deserve this. Thank you for being here. >> thank you. >> goodness, the first time I spoke in this chamber was as a 19-year-old against redevelopment and was african american removal. Now we have gentrification. There are many rewards for fighting the good fight not the least of which is working with people like aaron and nancy and our north beach posse. It's made easier by the skrchs -- sacrifice and determination of progressive candidates. Fighting greed-driven profits and militarism for people and planet has been rewarding. From the veterans of the international brigade in the spanish civil war, the good fight, to the american men and women of the vietnam war one of whom is here today who overcame guilt and remorse to work actively for reparation. I commend our young veterans for peace as well. Please be sure to walk across the street to the veterans gallery from March 17 to April 22 to see the waging peace exhibit which highlights our military heroes in the resistance to the american war in vietnam. Many of whom still live here today in this great city in san francisco. Thank you. >> thank you. >> okay. I want to thank everyone for this amazing group of honorees and I also want to thank the friends of the department and their director. And verna lizakaba. There's a reception in room 201 for all their honorees and their guests. Thank you, friends, for support and all you do to advance the rights of women and girls everywhere. Dr. Morasi can we have you come up again? So this will be your last women's history month celebration you will be leading in this capacity and on behalf of the board I'd like to recognize Dr. Emily morasi for her service to the city of san francisco. She'll be leaving her role as the director of the department of status of women in a few weeks. I want to make sure to recognize her as part of our women's history month celebration today. Emily has dedicated her career to advancing the rights of women and girls and for the past 15 years she has served as the director of the san francisco department of status of women. Under her direction the department has made contributions to ending violence against women stopping human trafficking, building gender equity in workplace and advancing women's human rights at the local, national and global level. Emily also oversaw the creation of san francisco collaborative against human trafficking in 2010 and mayor's task force on anti-human trafficking in 2013 and led the launch of the national campaign to advance women's human rights called cities for c-e-d-a-l-w with 50 cities and counties and salt lake city and miami-dade county. Emily, thank you for your hard work and dedicated work to the city and county of san francisco. Your work has changed the lives of countless women and girls in san francisco and beyond and so I'll be offering you this. [Applause] >> I just have one thing to say this is more than a quarter of my life and spent it with many of you in the room and women continue to hold up the sky and will continue to hold up the sky. Thank you very much. >> that concludes our special accommodations for today and happy women's history month and make sure to get out and vote. Still have time. Madame Clerk let's go to our 3:00 P.M. Special order call items 29 and 30 together. >> Clerk: [Reading item] >> colleagues, we will now be convening as a committee of the whole. Does the district 6 supervisor wish to make any remarks? . >> no. >> supervisor peskin do you want to say something about the item? >> with regard to item 25 I do not need to speak to the item. >> I'd like to have department staff come up to make a few brief remarks. >> good afternoon. I'm javi rivera from public works. This is concerning the 301 mission building located south of mission between fremont and beale. The department of building inspection has reviewed a proposed design to structurally upgrade grade the 301 mission street tower. It was determined that part of the structural upgrade will be placed infrastructure in what is currently public right-of-way. This piece of legislation is more of a legal exercise than a standard street vacation. When streets typically are vacated the vacation area is removed from the public right-of-way and becomes a city-owned parcel. It can be retained by the city or can be conveyed to a third party. When the city retains the parcel, the city has the ability to grant a lease or easement over all or a portion of the vacated area. In this case the legislation we are going to use covers three phases . First, portions of mission street and fremont street will be vacate from the sidewalk level down to a depth of 300 feet. This will split off city-owned parcels below grade while keeping the above street level grade as public right-of-way. Next, an easement will be granted to the owners of 301 mission street over portions of the below-grade streets. This is shown on file on pages 2 and 3. Finally, after the easement is recorded the vacated property will be restored to public right-of-way subject to the easements that were recorded. The street vacation was processed as required by local and state law. On February 13, postings were placed on fremont and mission street as required by california streets and highways code. No objections were receive from city agencies, private utility companies or fronting property owners. It's important to note this is a conditional street vacation and it will not become effective until the board of supervisors approves three item. First the vacation area. Currently it's subject to the public trust doctrine. The public trust exchange legislation must be approved and effective. Second, the settlement ordinance related to the 301 mission street litigation must be finalized and effective. And finally the board of supervisors must approve the easement for structural elements in the vacated area. If you have any questions concerns the street vacation process I'm glad to answer. >> seeing nobody on the roster, thank you very much for your presentation. Okay. Are there any members of the public who wish to speak on this particular item? Seeing none, public comment is now closed. [Gavel] . Colleagues, if there are no other comments, this hearing has been heard and filed. We are now reconvening as the board of supervisors on item 30. Can we take this -- I don't know if we need to take roll call or not? Shamann's not here. >> we should take a roll call. [Roll call] >> there are nine ayes. >> a 9-0 vote. This ordinance is passed on first reading unanimously. Madame Clerk let's go to the 3:00 P.M. Special meeting order 31 through 34. >> Clerk: items 31 through 34. [Reading items] >> okay. Supervisor haney. >> yes, I'd like to move for items 31 through 34 to be continued to April 14 both appellant and the project sponsor have requested a continuance with continuing to April 14th they're using the time to reach the resolution agreeable to all parties involved. >> with the understanding this hearing will be continued, we will now take public comment and . Are there any members of the public who wish to speak on the continuance of 31 through 34. Seeing none public comment is now closed. There's a motion by supervisor heaney to continue the item to April 14, 2020? seconded by supervisor ronin. Could we have roll call. >> Clerk: roll call on the continuance or without objection? >> without objection. >> Clerk: I see you're looking for a roll call. [Roll call] >> Clerk: there are 11 ayes. >> okay. The motion passes. The items will be continued. Madame Clerk let's go back to item 25. I'm sorry, there's somebody on the roster. Supervisor stefani. >> I'd like to move to rescind the vote on 30. I wasn't here neither was supervisor walton. >> motion to rescind seconded by supervisor peskin without objection we rescind the vote on item 30. [Gavel] >> okay. Should we just take roll call then? Roll call, please on item 30. >> Clerk: [Roll call] >> there are 11 ayes. >> okay. It passes unanimously. Item 25, please. >> Clerk: item 25 a controversy of redevelopment property. >> this came to the land kuse use and transportation committee coming to the board pending information from public works which information has been forthcoming. This is the proposed transference of parcels under redevelopment and then faced out off the administration of under then-governor jerry brown. there was an interim period where ocii had the properties and they are charged with disopposing of the properties -- disposing of the properties. Some are proposed for transference to the mayor's office housing development and up with to rec and mark and several to public works. In committee it became clear a number of the parcels which are sidewalks and streets that were proposed for transference to public works would actually require the city to shell out money from our general fund to bring them up to acceptable standards. We forwarded the item of the full board pending information from public works as to what it would cost. There are current estimate albeit back of the envelope estimate is $61,000. What I asked public works and the city administrator's office and ocii to do was to prepare legislation to sever the three pieces of sidewalks and streets, burk avenue, cargo way, zelle. The legislation not prepared and would like to continue the item one week. >> seconded by supervisor ronin for our meeting March 10. If there's no objection then motion carries. [Gavel] >> I think we're back to roll call. >> Clerk: [Roll call] >> I have one item a resolution urging governor newsom to pardon two individuals facing exportation at the hands of the trump administration. [Listing names] They have both experienced extraordinarily challenging childhoods. One was born in war-torn laos and separated from siblings and lived at a refugee camp before arriving in california. Danny has never lived in laos and was born in a refugee camp in thailand after his family fled the war where they later resettled in stockton. Both boys grew up in a time when tough on crime policies criminalized communities of color resulting in mass incarceration and children serving life sentence. Poverty, violence and lack of opportunities especially among refugee families shaped their experiences. As youth, they got caught up in a system that led to more violence and tragedy. At 22 one was incarcerated for second-degree murder and sentenced to 30 years. At 17, following the murder of his brother, danny was incarcerated for the death of a man and injury of two others. Rehabilitation and justice is possible. They pent -- spent their decades behind bars finding education, community support and redemption and parole and release for their positive behavior. Both became community advocates with the asian prisoner support community. One earned an associate degrees while incarcerated and encouraged other prisoners to join the college program increasing the participants from 4 to 300 and now lives in san francisco working as a housing manager and cleaning streets in oakland china town and connecting homeless individuals with resources and spearheading a campaign to move 38 individuals from the streets into the oak street community cabins. Danny, while incarcerated, explored trauma through self-help work shops to understand the root causes of violence and found therapy, healing, transformation and accountability through spiritual practice. He became a member of a juvenile life youth offender group called kid creating awareness together at san quinton and help advocate for the passing of california's sb260 and 261 fair sentencing for youth which afforded many youth impact california's justice justice system. After two decade of in cart -- incarceration he was trafrs transferred to I.C.E. And sat in jail two months. Fortunately he was released because there was no formal repatriation agreement between his home country and the U.S. He's currently a campaigner nor re-investment coalition of alameda county. Many community members continue to live in fear and criminalization harms public safety for all. The united states is the only home they know. It would be unjust to deport them tearing families a part. We must continue to stand up to trump and fight for justice where a person's value is not deemed by their immigration status or whether they have been incarcerated. I urge you to support my resolution in requesting pardon. The rest I submit. >> Clerk: supervisor peskin. >> thank you, Madame Clerk. I will rise to only one thing and the rest I'll submit, as I think we all the saw and were informed of this weekend on sunday, one of our vehicles of public works vehicle struck and hit and killed a 67-year-old woman from my district. At the southern ends of my district while she was crossing the street at geary and taylor. She was a health care worker who lives in china town with her husband and son and on behalf of the city and county of san francisco I want to extend our deepest condolences and apologies to her son and husband during what must be the most horrible point in their lives. She is the second pedestrian killed since the beginning calendar year and her death continues to highlight the need for us all to take vision zero seriously and implement reforms as quickly as possible and the city has convened a large vehicle working group through the sfmta and I think it's clear the trainings need to continue on a regular basis and we joined with walk sf and urging the sfmta the left-hand turn calming project as well as no right-hand turns on red and the association has led to many new scramble signals in china town over the last 20 years but moving forward with that same policy three rest of the city and -- through the rest of the city and county of san francisco has been difficult we need to step that up. We also know our police department needs to step up cracking down on focus on the 5 and hoping the advent of new technologies particularly and let me say it, once again and again automated speed enforcement all 11 of us and the mayor would be remarkable thank you President Yee for your leadership around that and to my successor and predecessor, assembly member chu who has been trying to move that forward at the state level because we require state authorization and I hereby respectfully urge, beg and plead the officers' association embrace automatic enforcement and it happened sunday and my condolences to the family and the rest I'll submit. >> Clerk: supervisor peskin. >> submit. >> Clerk: supervisor safai. Thank you. Supervisor stefani. >> thank you, Madame Clerk. I'd like to close in memory of jack fung who passed peacefully January 24 at the age of 83 and survived by his wife and grandchildren and his many loving friends, family and neighbors. Jack lived a life of extreme joy with an infectiously positive spirit until the end. He was 6 years old when his family moved to san francisco. Heage he graduated and continued his education in college. After his time in school he spent 12 years developing his carpentry skills and contributing to the construction of the buddhist church and the largest buddhist church in the united states. Jack credited his time at the church for teaching him the importance of spending each day in service to his community and helping others. His contributions to this church will continue to be appreciated for generation to come. As my neighbor for as long as I can remember, jack was known in the community as the mayor of greenwich street. I can tell you there was not a day jack wasn't ringing a neighbor's door bell reminding them to move their car before street cleaning or simply waving good morning and ask how you're doing and he served to the golden gate direct and retired as bridge captain after 34 years of service. As bridge captain he was tasked with the responsibility of ensuring the safety and protection of the public at the world famous bridge including sadly those attempting to take their own lives. Wiz told of -- I was told of one evening where jack came to the scene with a man was about to take his own life and he talked to the man for three hours and talked about baseball and after the man came down they decided to grab a drink. I don't know another story of a show of compassion and depth of humanity and willingness to serve. His compassion and friendly smile will be missed. His family, friends and neighbors will all remember his dedication to serving others and infectious spirit the mayor of greenwich street will be missed. >> Clerk: Mr. Walton. >> I want to honor two extraordinary women with a memoriam. I'm honoring brenda daye catrel. She spent time teaching and nurturing and giving her all. She was a long-time member of the randolph institute and sergeant-at-arms and help with conferences, recruitment for cohorts and community outreach. She worked tirelessly to connect her community with resources and get out the vote. She was also one of the members of the help sf project. She was not only a community advocate and activist but a very loving and caring mother and grandmother. A mother to many in a community but also a mother to seven children of her own. Brenda will be remembered by her contagious smile, strength, wisdom and out spokenness and ability to brighten up the room. If brenda wanted anything, she'd want you to remember that everyone deserves love and forgiveness and everyone deserves a chance to never give up on yourself or your community no matter what. I have known brenda several years. This loss is personal to me as she has been a staple in the proterro hill. She will not see her new housing but her children and her grandchildren will. We will Miss Your advocacy. Next I'd like to honor stephanie oguin. She served as an executive assistant in the department of technology for 21 years. She was considered the soul of the department and was helpful to everyone and proactively supported bt leadership. Stephanie cared deeply about her family and her community. She sacrificed much of her time in making sure her son, nieces and nephews all made it to college. Stephanie dedicated every saturday strictly for her family. In fact, many of stephanie's friends say she never really had a free saturday because she always focussed on caring for her family. Stephanie was the life of the party and loved to dance, cook and have a great time with everyone. She was a caring, loving person to her friends and the community. Stephanie lived in bay view and loved the 49ers. She always wore a new red and gold outfit to represent the niners at tailgate parties. Today we honor her commitment and sacrifices for her family and community and her compassion and most importantly her life. The rest I submit. >> Clerk: thank you, supervisor. Supervisor yee. >> submit. >> Clerk: thank you, Mr. President. Seeing no other names on the roster the concludes the introductions. My apologies. >> yes, I have two introductions today. Thank you very much. Colleagues, today I'm inter introducing several hearings for the spring budget cycles and on specific budgets we want to understand and mls -- policy issues on non-profits and the issues of homelessness and criminal justice and workforce development for vulnerable populations. Departmental hearings will focus on the department of public health, police department and public works and the mayor's office of housing and community development. We'll be updating the calendar and up on the website by tomorrow morning. I'm also introducing an ordinance my office has been working on more than two years to adopt a good food purchasing policy san francisco hospitals and jails. It's a model developed in 2012 to incentivize public institutions to improve purchasing standards. They've been adopted by institutions in los angeles, chicago, oakland, boston and and washington, D.C. And san francisco unified school direct. The good food purchasing program establishes supply chain transparency from farm to fork and evaluate how current practices align with a set of standards and assist with goal setting and measured progress and some institutional successes in shifting towards a value-based purchasing model. At its core it guides how public dollars are spent on food procurement and whether the funds are spend on vendors that share our values for a valued workforce and a focus on local economy and sustainability and animal welfare and nutrition. I'm proud today after years of coordination, meetings and hearings and after both sheriff departments and department of public health have analyzed our count food vinders. We're ready to announce adoption of the good food purchasing policy and setting the goals in the next few years to transform the way our jails and hospitals purchase food. Thank you to the department of public health and the sheriff's department as well as community advocates for their diligence and hard work to advance this policy to make sure we put our money where our mouths are when we purchase food to serve in san francisco hospitals and jails. The rest I submit. >> Clerk: thank you, supervisor. Mr. President, that concludes the introduction of new business. >> that will bring us to I believe committee reference. >> Clerk: public comment. At this time the public May address the entire board up to two minutes on jurisdiction over the board to include the minutes on the agenda, the items 37 through 43 on the adoption without reference to committee items and direct your remarks to the board as a whole and not individual members. Those seeking interpretation assistance will be allotted twice the amount of time. If you'd like to display a document on the overhead projector use the device. >> good afternoon. In 2002, 2009 and 2016 I are received horrible news when my sisters told me my nephews were all shot in the head several times. All of them. Of the three, two were intended targets. Two were not intended targets, excuse me. Of the three, two died. Of the three no one has been apprehended. I do not blame congress, the nra or even hollywood for the loss of my nephews. Quite frankly, I could have been a better uncle. But last April I came and also sent e-mails to this board calling for the city and county of san francisco to ban the film industry from any scene that involved guns. Now what had happened was I received a response from three legislative aides. They said to me they loved the idea. But when they told me they would get back to me after speaking to the supervisors, crickets. I think we can do this and show the world there's more than one way to get the attention of those involved in promoting gun violence. >> thank you. Next speaker. >> well, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls listening here -- >> Clerk: into the microphone. >> sorry, it's been a while since I've been by a mic. I know last month was black history month and many things have gone on since going baltimore and got away from one crooked city and there's corruption all over y'all. I used to say this is the most racist and corrupt city in the world but going to baltimore and seeing the comparison I was glad to come back to the city by the bay particularly because the politics going on here the young -- some of you young supervisors are new here. Now, I'm 65, 66, thank God. I've been around a long time but I only got a minute so I'll go fast. I've been around you 30 years at city hall I call silly hall. You progressives and moderates got to get together and solve it. What is that? Black population going down. Hats off to district 10 for doing reparations. Habits -- hats off to district 1 for putting together the office of racial equality I come from the old school without migration and other things. I'm the czar of that and I'll be handling everything and videotaping everything and we're going to make this thing happen in the city by the bay. My name is ace and I'm on the case. I don't have too much time here but people were talking about waypac. I'm the last director of that the project committee and my new supervisor welcome to the city. We'll sit down and talk and I'll give you the history and I have all the history. Can you show this on the screen here? Sf gov t I'm here defending. My name is ace. I'm up here defending the queen b. I know next week we'll have public hearings. I wasn't around when I all the corruption thing was going on but I want y'all to know at city hall take your time on your investigations. [Audio cut] >> thank you Mr. Washington. >> Clerk: thank you, Mr. Washington. >> linda chapman. I'm here for the statute that requires SOPs for the investigation of elder abuse and disabled abuse. I came here before a number of months ago about what occurred at the jewish home. The terrible threat to the public safety up there and since then the corruption and special victims unit, which I think I mentioned before and where it's been confirmed the entire four-month investigation every piece of evidence just disappeared. Just disappeared into space. Where kaiser proceeded to cover up saying we were very concerned and we looked into it but it's all a secret and where the police commission was very responsive. They directed the chief of police months ago to re-open the investigation of the jewish home and investigate the detectives but none of that's happened yet and I got a call from an investigator from the city in the process of investigating and kara in the process of arranging with the police commission staff to meet with them about procedures and get tfrs implemented but hundreds of people are at risk from something so much worse than the laguna honda which I came to in the first place. I cannot say I've ever single seen where we haven't seen supervisors humane and concerned with public welfare and yet complete silence on this matter. i just don't know how to understand it. At the police commission there was a report on 18 months of findings by the accountability unit which raised several subjects which caused the police commission concerns related to this. I think you might want to ask me questions about this or whatever. You have that data matter. [Audio cut] >> thank you very much. Next speaker. >> good afternoon, supervisors. My name is abdala amega. I've been a taxi driver and bought the medallion and paid $50,000. During my term and up to today I paid $80,000 and owe the bank $170,000. I'm a father of five kids. Still begging you for money back. I cannot even take my kids to in-n-out burger. I cannot afford for real. You know, I am the same as you. Woe have lives. We need to exist. Yesterday I called 3-1-1 complaining. I'm driving for nothing from afternoon to today until right now I didn't make $55. I'm behind. I didn't even pay my [Indiscernible] Last month and this month and I have a payment this week. What should I do? I should go and rob a bank? We're not okay. We have faith in you. We always say we have faith in you. What we should do? i can't even bye socks. I can't bye nothing. I'm really behind. Really behind. Please, we need to hear from you. There's no communication. I don't know. Stop the greed in the city. Please do that for my kids' retirement. Please give them not for me, give my kids the $80,000 what I paid. I'm pleading you. 25 years I didn't get a ticket. Two speeding tickets. >> thank you very much. Next speaker. >> hello, my name is mia. And this is one of the things that I've been working on as far as making history in peace. Prior to school I was [Indiscernible] So I got tired at federal court in washington, D.C. And [Indiscernible] It's a disaster with our police department. The police department [Indiscernible] When I was here before. Because of some representative in 1984. [Indiscernible] Making sure the police department is better off in understanding why these things are under policy and it's a coincidence. Climate change is one of the things. [Audio cut] >> thank you. Next speaker. >> supervisors, my name is donald belase. I'm the owner-operator cab driver. You guys had the power to make the decision. please find out how to return the money back. Let me announce we have nine more infrastructures this -- foreclosures this month. I don't want to be there. Nine more families. I beg you, do something for us. Find out how the city can return our money. Thank you. >> thank you. Next speaker. >> hello. I'm going to put a slide in real quick. The reason I'm here is because I was born and raised in the city. When I look around my city, I see a node for more positive -- need for more positive public announcements in the city. A public announcement is made for the good of the public. What is the problem? The problem is there is uninformed communities, and there's not enough positive educational announcements I can see. I don't know of any single organization that deals with messages in the city. I see inappropriate uninformed advertisement or advertisements up and never taken down. I wish I could show you the pictures I have here but there's one that triggered me and it was hook-ups equals squirt on a t line to third street. I don't know if you can see it but I thought why would we have that on the side of our bus when we can have more positive things? Also this with london breed and that brings more hatred to the city so I don't know why that hasn't been taken down but has anyone seen what's being put up and monitoring it? Then I would love to see something that says education is a more powerful weapon and we can use it around the city or does anyone know when world environmental day is when is June maybe in the tenderloin. [Audio cut] >> thank you. Next speaker. >> the former supervisor recently performed the district attorney has been performing the district attorney's. When it comes to ethics commission I do not wish to reward failure by redirecting $1.7 million towards an office that already enjoyed an 8% budget increase. The ethics commission remains short-staffed and I request you solicit candidate nominations, recommendations or suggestions as proposed by the U.S. Attorney's office ninth district court. The vacant appointment will expire February 2023. I'm hoping we can see a vastly more will dedicated towards cleaning up the city however, it would be a birt investment at present by several single-family homes and apartments and to serve as public toilets than to serve a single public portable toilet and the hydrant has been part of the city's waste problem. The last subject is the story regarding the positive identification of the homicide victim was carried on 65 media outlets across the state and toronto, canada to sydney, australia. >> tom gilberte. Over half a year ago a group of young women were and were asking for help. They were renters. Plore recently in October mission activists were here and upset at what was happening at 344 14th street. As they were leaving the chamber one gent million remarks off microphone near the door the policy needs changing. Years ago they brought up the subject of a mythological asian family who saved their money and bought a duplex and the grandmother got sick and they had to sell the property in response to protesting a law that said if you sold your newly-bought property before a certain amount of time you were penalized and he was against that as was the mayor. I remarked at this firing phone at that time what about the 6 6,000 or 7,000 people that had been evicted from their american dream. Just a few months ago in August the district attorney has a whole to play in protecting tenants. There were 40,000 people evicted in the city from 6,000 or 7,000 to 40,000 there's negligence here at city hall about asking people to vote for them and allowing them to be evicted. Another article we work here but we can't live here. That's on the drawing board. This is a time we can do change john rayham is leaving the city. The planning department could use focus. We could have the whole board here a 3:00 special. [Audio cut] >> thank you. >> why not? >> any other speakers? Come on up, please. That will be our last public comment coming up. >> I just want to start with hilary. You told me to come by your office. I've been by your office, please. >> Clerk: please address the board as a whole. >> let the whole board know that hilary asked me to come to her office. I came by to speak with her regarding issues in the community and her staff have been too busy. It seems like they've been busy on the phone. I don't get it. Why am I being blocked out. I guess the picture I'm going to show is a violation of the standards of care and in the midst of a resource -- core owe na virus and -- core corona virus and peskin walks out. Remember we're in election time. While we're in crisis. The only parallels I'm making to these pictures are nazi concentration camps. You put people in these rooms improperly ventilation and expect them to be healthy with tuberculosis and coronavirus and did you see the report of 95% of homeless being put back on the street.
