PRESIDENT VANDEMAN AND THANK YOU COLLEAGUES. COLLEAGUES BEFORE YOU TODAY IS OUR BUDGET AND DRILLING
LEGISLATION. THIS YEAR'S BUDGET REQUIRE NOT
JUST SOLVING FOR OUR CURRENT $800 MILLION DEFICIT.
AS YOUR BUDGET COMMITTEE CHAIR, I RECOGNIZE THAT THE FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT'S ATTACKS AND IMPENDING CUTS PUT US IN A
IMPOSSIBLE POSITION GIVING THIS REALITY WE HAD TO FOCUS ON THE
CORE MISSION OF CITY GOVERNMENT KEEPING PEOPLE HOUSE FED
AND CARE FOR. AS I SAID ON BUDGET NIGHT TWO
WEEKS AGO, THE AGREEMENT BEFORE US TODAY FOR ITS FIRST VOTE MAY
NOT BE SOMETHING WE ALL CAN FULLY CELEBRATE BUT WE MUST
ACKNOWLEDGE HOW WE HAVE COME TOGETHER DESPITE OUR
DIFFERENCES TO MEET THIS MOMENT. THANKS TO THE PARTNERSHIP OF MAYOR DANIEL LURIE AND WITH THE
SUPPORT FROM OUR COLLEAGUES ON THE BUDGET AND APPROPRIATE
ACTION COMMITTEE. WITH TODAY'S VOTE WE COME TOGETHER TO DELIVER FOR OUR MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES.
THE BUDGET PACKAGE BEFORE US TODAY GUARD AGAINST DRACONIAN
CUTS FROM THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION BY PUTTING $400
MILLION ON RESERVE SO THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO
PROVIDE MEDICAID, HOUSING SUBSIDIES AND FOOD SECURITY
IN THE FACE OF THESE PENDING CUTS. WE STORE JOBS FOR ESSENTIAL CITY WORKERS REVERSING PROPOSED
LAYOFFS SO THAT WE CAN DELIVER THE SERVICES SAN FRANCISCANS
NEED AND DESERVE. WE PRESERVE FUNDING TO SOME
VITAL PROGRAMS AND SERVICES THAT IMPACT OUR MOST
MARGINALIZED INDIVIDUALS OUR PACIFIC ISLANDER COMMUNITY, OUR
NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITY, OUR TRANSITIONAL YOUTH TRANS YOUTH
ARE LGBTQ COMMUNITY OUR SENIORS, OUR IMMIGRANTS
COMMUNITY AND THEY RESTORE FUNDS FOR PEOPLE LIVING IN SINGLE ROOM OCCUPANCY HOTELS AND LEGAL SERVICES FOR PEOPLE
AT RISK OF LOSING THEIR HOUSING AND OTHER LEGAL RIGHTS.
AND WE CAME TOGETHER TO NEGOTIATE OUR CITY, OUR HOME PROP C ALLOCATION BY ADDING $17.3 MILLION FOR FAMILY
RAPIDLY HOUSING FOR A TOTAL OF ALMOST 30 MILLION AND AN
ADDITIONAL 9.5 MILLION FOR TRANSITIONAL H.Q. RAPID
REHOUSING FOR A TOTAL OF 19 MILLION, AN ADDITIONAL 3
MILLION FOR RV INTERVENTION AND HOMELESS PREVENTION MEASURES AND 9 MILLION FOR MEDIUM TERM HOUSING TOTALING 21
MILLION AND AN ADDITIONAL 3.4 MILLION FOR HOTEL VOUCHERS FOR
TRANSITIONAL YOUTH AND ADULTS. THIS IS ALL IN ADDITION TO THE
MAYOR'S FUNDING FOR SHELTER AND HYGIENE CARE.
I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE DID NOT DO THIS WORK ALONE.
I WANT TO GIVE MY SINCERE THANKS TO MY COLLEAGUES ON THE
BUDGET AND APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE ESPECIALLY OUR VICE CHAIR SUPERVISOR MATT DORSEY AND BOARD PRESIDENT RAFAEL
MENDELSOHN AND MEMBERS SHERMAN WALTON JORDAN GAUDIO.
THANK YOU SUPERVISORS. THANK YOU ALSO TO SOPHIA
KETTLER, THE MAYOR'S BUDGET DIRECTOR AND HER TEAM FOR HER
PARTNERSHIP DAN CONTRA AND THE ENTIRE BUDGET AND LEGISLATIVE
ANALYST'S TEAM AND SPECIAL SHOUT OUT TO HARVEY ROSS WHO
HAVE WORKED ON TIGHT DEADLINES TO GET US THEIR REPORTS.

COMPTROLLER TEAM FOR KEEPING US SAFE KEEPING US ON TRACK TO THE

AND OF COURSE THE TEAM OF LEGISLATIVE AIDES IN EACH OF
OUR OFFICES WHO MAKE SURE WE ARE WHERE WE NEED TO BE
ESPECIALLY ON TIME AND PREPARE FOR THE FIGHT.
>> SO COLLEAGUES, WE MAY NOT ALWAYS BE IN AGREEMENT.
WE WILL SPEAK ON OUR DIFFERENCES AND FIND COMMON GROUND TO DELIVER POLICY SOLUTIONS.
WE MUST CONTINUE WORKING TOGETHER TO MEET THIS MOMENT
BECAUSE SAN FRANCISCANS DESERVE TO HAVE US ALWAYS SPEAK THE
TRUTH ADVOCATES IN THEIR BEST INTERESTS AND WORK TOGETHER TO
DELIVER SOLUTIONS. I KNOW WE HAVE DONE SO
THROUGHOUT THIS YEAR'S BUDGET BUT OUR WORK IS NOT DONE.
THERE'S A LOT OF CHALLENGES AHEAD OF US NOT JUST BECAUSE OF
OUR LOCAL ECONOMY BUT THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS THE FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT AND FOR WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO NOT JUST TO SAN
FRANCISCO BUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND TO THE ENTIRE
NATION. WE OUGHT TO BE PREPARED.
WE OWE IT TO OURSELVES AND OUR DUTY AS ELECTIVE. BUT WE ALSO OWE IT TO SAN FRANCISCANS.
SO I HOPE TO HAVE YOUR VOTE AND YOUR SUPPORT FOR THE BUDGET
BEFORE US TODAY. THANK YOU.
>> THANK YOU. THANK MR..
>> THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND THANK YOU MADAM CLERK, FOR
ATTEMPTING TO MAINTAIN ORDER IN THE CHAMBER AND SUPERVISOR
DORSEY THANK YOU PRESIDENT MANDOLIN AS VICE CHAIR OF THE
BUDGET COMMITTEES I WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO THANK BUDGET
CHAIR CONNIE CHEN FOR HER HARD WORK AND EXPERTISE
AND ATTENTION TO DETAIL THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS.
SAN FRANCISCANS WERE INCREDIBLY WELL SERVED BY HER LEADERSHIP.
CONNIE AND I HAVE KNOWN EACH OTHER FOR THE BETTER PART OF 20
YEARS AND I REALLY JUST APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY THAT WE HAD TO WORK TOGETHER. I LEARNED A LOT AND I OFTEN
RESENT HAVING TO SAY THAT ABOUT PEOPLE WHO ARE YOUNGER THAN I
AM. BUT I REALLY DID AND I DID
APPRECIATE IT. LIKEWISE TO BOARD PRESIDENT RAFAEL MALDONADO FOR HIS LEADERSHIP AND GUIDANCE
AND STEWARDSHIP. I'VE WATCHED BUDGET PROCESSES
PLAY OUT IN THIS BUILDING FOR MORE THAN 20 YEARS AND I CAN
SAY WITH CONFIDENCE THIS IS ONE OF AMONG THE TOUGHEST.
IT WAS AN EXTRAORDINARILY UNCERTAIN YEAR.
WE ENTERED THIS BUDGET SEASON FACING A NEARLY $800 MILLION
DEFICIT ONE OF THE LARGEST IN OUR CITY'S HISTORY AND WE
STILL DON'T FULLY KNOW HOW DIFFICULT THINGS COULD GET IN THE YEARS AHEAD IN THE FACE OF FISCAL PRESSURE.
THIS BUDGET PRIORITIZES WHAT MATTERS MOST WHICH FOR ME
INCLUDES SECURING AND PROTECTING PUBLIC SAFETY.
WE MADE TARGETED REDUCTIONS ACROSS CITY GOVERNMENT BUT WE DID SO WITHOUT COMPROMISING FOUNDATIONAL SERVICES THAT KEEP
OUR CITY SAFE. WE ALSO SAFEGUARDED PUBLIC
HEALTH AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES STABILIZING HOUSING,
HOMELESSNESS INVESTMENTS WHERE POSSIBLE INCLUDING PRIORITIZING
DRUG FREE AND RECOVERY ORIENTED OPTIONS THAT ARE PARTICULARLY CLOSE TO MY HEART. WE PRESERVED VITAL PROGRAMS FOR
YOUTH, SENIORS AND WORKING FAMILIES.
AND PROUDLY WE STOOD STRONG FOR THOSE FACING HISTORICALLY
UNPRECEDENTED ATTACKS AND DEHUMANIZATION INCLUDING OUR TRANSGENDER AND IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES.
AT THE SAME TIME WE TOOK MEANINGFUL STEPS TO RIGHT SIZE
CITY GOVERNMENT. WE ELIMINATED VACANCIES, REDUCE
RELIANCE ON CONTRACTING, BROUGHT MORE DISCIPLINE TO HOW WE SPEND OUR PUBLIC DOLLARS. AND WE DID IT WITHOUT MASS
LAYOFFS. AND THAT'S NO SMALL FEAT IN A
BUDGET OF THIS SIZE AND THE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACED.
YET WITH ALL THAT SAID, NO ONE IS CELEBRATING THE DECISIONS WE MADE. THEY WERE NECESSARY AND THEY
WERE RESPONSIBLE BUT THEY WERE DIFFICULT.
I'M OPTIMISTIC THAT WE ARE BEGINNING TO PIVOT AWAY FROM
ONETIME FIXES AND TOWARD REAL STRUCTURAL REFORM GIVING THE
LOOMING THREATS FROM THE FEDERAL LEVEL NEXT YEAR'S BUDGET COULD BE HARDER AND OUR WORK ISN'T OVER.
BUT THIS BUDGET LAYS A RESPONSIBLE FOUNDATION
REFLECTING SHARED SACRIFICE AND SHOWING WHAT'S POSSIBLE WHEN WE WORK TOGETHER. AND FOR THAT I WANT TO THANK
CHAIR CHAN AGAIN AND ALL MY COLLEAGUES FOR THEIR
PARTICIPATION IN THIS PROCESS. I'M GRATEFUL FOR THE SPIRIT OF
COLLABORATION WE HAVE MANAGED TO HAVE UNDER PRESIDENT RANDLEMAN LEADERSHIP. THANKS ALSO TO MAYOR LURIE
AND HIS TEAM AND THE CITY ATTORNEY AND THE COMPTROLLER.
I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THE WORK WITH ALL OF YOU IN THE MONTHS AHEAD. >> THANK YOU.
SUPERVISOR FIELDER THANK YOU PRESIDENT VANDEMAN.
COLLEAGUES, I WANT TO BEGIN BY THANKING MY AIDE FUNG HORN FOR
LEADING THE BUDGET WORK IN MY OFFICE AND CHURCH AND IN THE
BUDGET COMMITTEE FOR TAKING ON THE NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TASK OF
CLOSING A $750 MILLION DEFICIT OVER TWO YEARS.
>> IT'S A RELIEF THAT ACTUALLY SO MANY VITAL PROGRAMS
ESPECIALLY IN OUR SAFETY NET WERE PRESERVED THANKS TO CHAIR
CHAN'S LEADERSHIP. WE AVOIDED DOZENS OF
DEVASTATING LAYOFFS TO THE CITY WORKFORCE. >> STREET CLEANING GRAFFITI ABATEMENT AND VENDING
ENFORCEMENT IN THE MISSION WERE PROTECTED.
COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT STAFF ON 16TH STREET ARE GOING TO BE MOVED. THEY'RE DOING ESSENTIAL WORK.
I'M GRATEFUL TO THE MAYOR FOR HELPING PRESERVE THAT AND TO MY
COLLEAGUES WHO FOUGHT TO PROTECT OUR CULTURAL DISTRICT'S WORKFORCE PROGRAMS AND LEGAL SERVICES THAT SERVE DISTRICT
NINE'S MOST VULNERABLE. >> THANK YOU.
ESPECIALLY TO SUPERVISORS WALTON AND AND GUARDIANS. AS YOU ALL KNOW, FAMILY HOMELESSNESS HAS BEEN ONE OF MY
TOP PRIORITIES SINCE COMING TO THIS BOARD.
>> IT'S NOT JUST A POLICY FAILURE.
IT'S A MORAL FAILURE THAT IN ONE OF THE RICHEST CITIES
IN THE WORLD 1800 CHILDREN AND AS OF USD ARE HOMELESS.
>> MY OFFICE ALONGSIDE FAITH AND ACTION THE COALITION ON
HOMELESSNESS AND COURAGEOUS IMMIGRANT MOTHERS HAS FOUGHT
HARD TO CHANGE THAT. >> THOSE MOTHERS CAME HERE
AGAIN AND AGAIN TO SHARE THEIR STORIES AND DEMAND THAT THE
CITY DO BETTER. THEY ASKED FOR $66 MILLION
AND FAMILY HOMELESSNESS. AND WHILE WE DIDN'T GET ALL OF
THAT, I'M INCREDIBLY PROUD WE SECURED $20 MILLION FOR
HOMELESS FAMILIES AND 9 MILLION FOR YOUTH HOUSING.
THAT HAPPENED BECAUSE FAMILIES THEMSELVES LED THE FIGHT.
>> THANK YOU TO CHAIR CHAN FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP.
SURVIVORS WALTON CHEN MAHMOOD AND MELGAR FOR YOUR PARTNERSHIP
. I WANT TO THANK MY STAFF JEN FERRIGNO AND THE DEPARTMENT LEADERS AT AGE OSAGE AND THE
MAYOR'S OFFICE WHO WORKED IN GOOD FAITH TO MAKE THIS POSSIBLE. BUT NOW I.
I NEED TO SPEAK TRUTHFULLY ABOUT THE PARTS OF THIS BUDGET
THAT ARE INDEFENSIBLE. AND I SAY THIS WITH THE UTMOST
RESPECT TO MY COLLEAGUES WHO WORK TIRELESSLY IN BUDGET
HEARINGS. AND I SAY THIS WITH DEEP
DISAPPOINTMENT IN THE MAYOR'S CHOICES.
>> THE MAYOR HAS TALKED A LOT ABOUT HARD DECISIONS AND YES,
HE MADE THEM. HE PUT LAYOFFS ON THE TABLE.
HE SLASHED NONPROFIT BUDGETS. HE DEMANDED 15% CUTS ACROSS
DEPARTMENTS. >> BUT YOU KNOW, IT WAS NEVER
ON THE TABLE. LAW ENFORCEMENT OVERTIME
IN FACT IN A DEFICIT YEAR AS IF PD AND THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT
GOT A $50 MILLION INCREASE AFTER THIS BOARD GAVE THEM $90
MILLION AND REAPPROPRIATE REAPPROPRIATED OVERTIME EARLIER THIS YEAR WHILE PROGRAMS SERVING IMMIGRANTS FAMILIES
BIPOC AND LGBTQ COMMUNITIES WERE GUTTED.
LAW ENFORCEMENT WALKED AWAY WITH MORE MONEY.
>> AND LET'S NOT PRETEND THIS IS NEW EVERY YEAR AS A PD COMES
BACK TO THIS BOARD ASKING FOR MORE MONEY AFTER THE FACT.
THIS YEAR WE JUST GAVE IT TO THEM UPFRONT AND FOR WHAT?
>> SO THEY CAN MOONLIGHT AS PRIVATE SECURITY UNDER THE TEN
B PROGRAM WHILE URGENT CALLS GOING TO ANSWERED SO THEY CAN
PRIORITIZE POLITICAL PROTESTS OVER FOOT PATROLS IN PLACES
LIKE 16TH STREET. THIS IS NOT GETTING BACK TO THE BASICS. IT'S TURNING OUR BACK ON THE
PUBLIC AND DISTRICT NINE. >> MY DISTRICT WAS HIT
ESPECIALLY HARD IN THIS BUDGET .
COMMUNITY AMBASSADORS ARTS AND CULTURE THE CLIMATE EQUITY
HUB FOOD PANTRIES GONE. BUT TO CUTS STAND OUT AS
ESPECIALLY DEVASTATING MUNI SERVICE AND IMMIGRATION LEGAL
DEFENSE. >> LET'S TALK ABOUT MUNI.
THIS BOARD DOESN'T CONTROL AS OFTEN AS BUDGET BUT WE DO
CONFIRM THE MTA BOARD APPOINTED ENTIRELY BY THE MAYOR.
>> AND THIS MAYOR LIKE EVERY MAYOR MUST BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE
FOR THE DECISIONS OF HIS APPOINTEES. >> THIS BUDGET CUTS MUNI LINES TO SAVE $7 MILLION WHILE AS THE
MTA IS SITTING ON $140 MILLION IN RESERVES THEY COULD HAVE
MADE A DIFFERENT CHOICE. THEY DIDN'T. I RIDE THE 49 BUS EVERY PACKED POTHOLE RIDDEN RIDE IS A
REMINDER OF HOW WORKING PEOPLE IN THIS CITY ARE IGNORED
AND DEPRIORITIZED. MEANWHILE THE MAYOR IS ROLLING OUT THE RED CARPET FOR WAYMO. THIS IS AUSTERITY FOR THE
PEOPLE AND CORPORATE GIVEAWAYS. >> IT'S DISGRACEFUL.
AND FINALLY, IMMIGRATION LEGAL DEFENSE. IN A MOMENT WHEN TRUMP IS PLEDGING MASS DEPORTATIONS, THE
CITY HAS CHOSEN TO FLATLINE LEGAL DEFENSE FUNDING.
>> THAT'S NOT NEUTRAL. >> THAT'S THAT'S A CUT.
STAFF ARE ALREADY BEING LAID OFF.
FAMILIES ALREADY BEING LEFT DEFENSELESS. MEANWHILE, COUNTIES LIKE SAN MATEO AND SANTA CLARA ARE
INCREASING FUNDING UP TO $5 MILLION.
WE'RE FALLING BEHIND AND OUR CONSTITUENTS WILL PAY THE
PRICE. THIS IS NOT LEADERSHIP.
>> THIS IS ABANDONMENT. FOR ALL THOSE REASONS I CANNOT
IN GOOD CONSCIENCE VOTE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BUDGET.
AND I WILL BE VOTING NO. WITH DISAPPOINTMENT, WITH
FRUSTRATION BUT ALSO WITH CLARITY ABOUT THE KIND OF CITY
WE ARE FIGHTING TO BECOME. WE OWE OUR RESIDENTS MORE THAN
AUSTERITY. WE OWE THEM DIGNITY. AND WITH THAT I ALSO WANT TO REQUEST TO SEVER ITEMS 716, 20,
ALL RIGHT, LET'S. WE ARE SUFFERING.
>> SEVEN. THERE ARE NO AUDIBLE SOUNDS OF
SUPPORT THAT IS FROM AN APPROVED BOARD RULE. WE DO APPRECIATE YOU ALL HERE THIS AFTERNOON.
>> JUST IF YOU WANT TO SHOW YOUR SUPPORT, DO IT QUIETLY, PLEASE. >> SEVEN WHAT ARE THE OTHER SIX
TEEN 2016 2021 AND 3120 21 AND 30.
>> 30 3130 ONE. THANK YOU.
OKAY. SUPER VISOR WALTON THANK YOU SO
MUCH. >> PRESIDENT MENEM IN FIRST
WANT TO START OFF BY THANKING ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES ON A
BUDGET AND APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE ESPECIALLY CHAIR CHAN
FOR WORKING HARD TO PRESERVE VITAL SERVICES AND FOR DOING
WHAT WE COULD TO ADDRESS SEVERAL GAPS THAT EXISTED FROM
THE MAYOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET. I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE BUDGET
AND LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE THE CONTROLLERS OFFICE,
THE MAYOR'S BUDGET TEAM ESPECIALLY SOPHIA KETTLER FOR
ALL OF THEIR WORK. >> ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES
AND ESPECIALLY ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES AIDES AND OF COURSE
MY DISTRICT TEN OFFICE AND THE AMAZING TRACY BROWN GUAJARDO
FOR ALL OF HER WORK THROUGH THIS TOUGH BUDGET PROCESS THIS
YEAR. I HAVE NEVER AGREE WITH ALL
ASPECTS OF A CITY BUDGET BUT IN SEVEN YEARS OF WORKING ON
THE BUDGET IN THIS CAPACITY I HAVE NEVER SEEN SUCH DRAMATIC
PROPOSED CUTS IN THE TAX ON LOW INCOME FAMILIES, PEOPLE OF
COLOR AND POPULATIONS THAT NEED US THE MOST.
I KNOW WE HAVE A BUDGET DEFICIT BUT THERE WAS NO FOCUS IN THIS
PROPOSED BUDGET BUDGET ON INCLUDING ADDITIONAL REVENUE TO
ADDRESS BUDGET GAPS THAT EXISTS.
THE MAYOR'S ORIGINAL REDUCTIONS FOCUSED ON CUTS TO PROGRAMS
LIKE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT, HEALTH SERVICES AND PUBLIC
HOUSING COMMUNITIES. REDUCING RESOURCES FOR
PERMANENT HOUSING ELIMINATING SOME AREAS OF LEGAL DEFENSE
AND REMOVING CRUCIAL SERVICES PROVIDED BY NEIGHBORHOOD HUBS.
TOGETHER WE RESTORED SOME OF THESE VITAL SERVICES BUT WE
COULD NOT SAVE EVERYTHING AND EVERYONE.
I AM COMMITTED TO FOCUSING ON GARNERING ADDITIONAL REVENUE
AND SUPPORTING SECURING RESOURCES TO FULLY RESTORE MANY
PROGRAMS THAT ARE GOING TO SUFFER FROM THIS BUDGET
REDUCTIONS. THIS BUDGET IS NOT IDEAL BUT
THE WORK WAS DONE TO DECREASE THE NEGATIVE IMPACTS FOR SO
MANY AND I DO WANT TO THANK THE COMMUNITY AND MY COLLEAGUES FOR
THAT AND I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS BUDGET BECAUSE AT THE END
OF THE DAY A LOT OF THE SERVICES A LOT OF THE THINGS
THAT I BELIEVE IN WERE PRESERVED THROUGH THIS BUDGET
PROCESS. MOST CERTAINLY WE DID NOT GET
EVERYTHING THAT WE CONTINUOUSLY HAVE TO FIGHT FOR BUT THE HARD
DECISIONS WERE MADE AND THE BUDGET APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE
DID COME TOGETHER TO PRESERVE MANY VITAL SERVICES.
THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT. THANK YOU. AS ONE SUPERVISOR CHEN THANK YOU PRESIDENT RANDLEMAN.
COLLEAGUES, WE HAVE BEEN FACING THE CRUCIAL TASK OF ADAPTING
OUR CITY BUDGET AND THIS PROCESS HAS INVOLVED MAKING
EXTREMELY CHALLENGING TRADEOFFS.
THE BUDGET ISN'T JUST A LEDGER OF NUMBERS WE ALL KNOW THAT.
BUT IT'S SIGNIFIES OUR COMMITMENTS TO THE PEOPLE
IN OUR LOCAL NEIGHBORHOODS AND COMMUNITIES. >> IT IS ABOUT ENSURING THAT AS MANY OF OUR COMPETING VALUES
ARE REPRESENTED IN OUR FINAL BUDGET DOCUMENT.
>> THIS PROCESS HAS DEMANDED OPEN MINDS VERY HONEST DIALOGS
AND A WILLINGNESS TO COMPROMISE EVERY DOLLAR WE ALLOCATE OR
CHOOSES NOT TO ALLOCATE HAS A RIPPLE EFFECT.
>> IT IMPACTS THE ESSENTIAL SERVICES OUR RESIDENTS RELY ON
DAILY OUR WORKFORCE ACROSS INDUSTRIES AND THE FABRIC OF
OUR CITY. WE KNOW THERE ARE PASSIONATE
ADVOCATES IN THE COMMUNITY REPRESENTED IN EVERY LINE ITEM.
I KNOW THAT I AM VERY CONCERNED ABOUT INVESTMENT IN MY OWN
DISTRICT TO SUSTAIN VITAL COMMUNITY SERVING PROGRAMS.
BUT WITH THAT I ALSO WANT TO REALLY APPRECIATE BUDGET CHAIR
CHEN, PRESIDENT RANDLEMAN AND THAT ENTIRE BUDGET
AND APPROPRIATION COMMITTEE AND THEIR STAFF FOR THEIR
SKEWED AND THOUGHTFUL LEADERSHIP THROUGH THE BUDGET
NEGOTIATION AND ESPECIALLY I WANT TO ASSURE ALL TO MY STAFF
JACKIE PRAGER AND LYNN CHILD CHIN FOR THEIR SUPPORT.
>> THIS IS THE SAME THING THAT I HAVE ASKED OF EVERY
DEPARTMENT. >> RECOGNIZING THAT THERE ARE INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT TIMES AND THAT MORE DIFFICULT TIMES
AHEAD AS IT IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER THAT WE CONTINUE TO
WORK DILIGENTLY TO PROTECT THE MOST VULNERABLE.
ADVOCATE FOR TRANSPARENCY AND IN GOOD FAITH PARTNERSHIPS
DO THAT AND DO WHAT WE CAN DO TO CONTINUE TO INCREASE ACCESS
ACROSS COMMUNITIES AND LANGUAGES. >> NOW THAT THIS BUDGET SEASON IS COMING TO AN END, WE ALSO
HAVE TO CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN THE FLEXIBILITY AND COMMUNICATION THAT WAS DEMONSTRATED THROUGHOUT THE
PROCESS. I MYSELF IS VERY COMMITTED TO
CONTINUE TO WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH ALL MY COLLEAGUES AND THE
MAYOR'S OFFICE TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT OUR NEIGHBORHOODS AND COMMUNITY AS WE CONTINUE TO PUSH SAN FRANCISCO INTO A
HEALTHIER, SAFER AND MORE EQUITABLE FUTURE.
SO AND I'M COMMITTED TO VOTE YES ON THE BUDGET.
>> THANK YOU. THANK YOU. SUPERVISOR CHEN. SUPERVISOR SAUDER.
THANK YOU, PRESIDENT BENJAMIN. I FIRST WANT TO THANK ALL OF MY
COLLEAGUES FOR HOW SERIOUSLY YOU TOOK THIS MATTER.
>> THIS HAS BEEN SOMETHING THAT WE FACED.
IT'S BEEN AN IMPOSSIBLE TASK TO FACE AND CERTAINLY FOR MANY OF
US IN THIS CHAMBER WHO ARE ON THE BOARD FOR THE FIRST TIME
FOR THE FIRST YEAR NOT WHAT WE WANTED TO DO COMING INTO OFFICE
. AND YET I THINK WE APPROACHED
THIS WITH THE RESPECT AND THE TONE THAT DESERVES WITH THESE
IMPORTANT DECISIONS. I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS
BUDGET. I AM IN PARTICULAR GRATEFUL TO
THE MAYOR'S OFFICE INTO OUR BUDGET CHAIR CHAN FOR THEIR
PRIORITIZATION OF MANY ISSUES THAT MATTER TO SAN FRANCISCO
AND PARTICULARLY TO MY DISTRICT .
I THINK OF THE YOU KNOW WHERE WE STARTED AND WHERE WE'RE
GOING TO END UP WITH RESTORING OUR SRO COLLABORATIVE FUNDS
WHICH ARE SO IMPORTANT IN PARTICULAR TO OUR LOW INCOME TENANTS AND SRO RESIDENTS IN CHINATOWN.
I THINK OF HOW FAR WE'VE COME IN RESTORING GENERAL LEGAL
SERVICES KNOWING HOW THAT IS A WISE INVESTMENT THAT KEEPS
PEOPLE HOUSED, KEEPS PEOPLE IN SHELTER WITH FAMILIES, THE
TENANTS RIGHT TO COUNSEL GIVING ANYONE FACING AN EVICTION A
FAIR SHOT FOOD SECURITY SOMETHING SO IMPORTANT GIVEN
THE DIFFICULT CUTS FROM THE STATE LEVEL AND FEDERAL LEVEL
THAT WE PRESERVE THAT HERE IN SAN FRANCISCO AND IN
EXPANSION OF STREET CLEANING PROGRAMS OR RESTORATION IN SOME
CASES THE STREET CLEANING PROGRAMS KNOWING THAT WE NEED
THOSE BASICS TO GROW OUR CITY. I WANT TO THANK BUDGET CHAIR
CHAN. I WANT TO THANK THE MAYOR'S
OFFICE AND EVERYONE INVOLVED. YOU KNOW, I THINK THIS WAS A
PROCESS WHERE NONE OF US ARE COMPLETELY HAPPY.
BUT FROM MY PERSPECTIVE AND I THINK FROM FROM MANY OF OUR PERSPECTIVES, THIS WAS A PROCESS THAT WAS DONE
IN COLLABORATION, WAS DONE IN TRANSPARENCY AND WITH
RESPECTING COMPROMISE AND THOSE ARE GOING TO BE QUALITIES AND TRAITS THAT THIS BOARD AND THIS PARTNERSHIP WITH THE
MAYOR'S OFFICE NEEDS TO CONTINUE TO DEMONSTRATE BECAUSE
WE HAVE DIFFICULT CHALLENGES AHEAD.
AND FOR ALL THOSE REASONS I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS.
THANK YOU. I JUST THOUGHT OUR SUPERVISOR MAHMOOD UM THANK YOU, EVERYONE. >> I JUST WANT TO KIND OF CALL
IT AGAIN IN AGREEMENT WITH MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES AS WELL THAT
THIS WAS A DIFFICULT BUDGET THAT WE HAD TO MAKE DIFFICULT DECISIONS AND NOT ALL ALL OF US DIDN'T GET WHAT WE WANTED.
I KNOW THERE WAS NONPROFITS IN THE TENDERLOIN THAT WE WERE
ADVOCATING FOR THAT UNFORTUNATELY WE'RE NOT ABLE TO MAKE IT. BUT I DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT
TO CALL OUT A MISSED A HISTORIC BUDGET DEFICIT WHAT WAS DONE
IN PARTNERSHIP AND IN ONE OF THE THINK CHAIR CHAN FOR HER LEADERSHIP ON THIS AS WELL AS IN CONVERSATION WITH THE MAYOR,
WE ARE VERY COGNIZANT OF WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE FEDERAL
ADMINISTRATION RIGHT NOW AND DUE TO THE WORK OF THE
BUDGET COMMITTEE WE DID HOLD I BELIEVE OVER $400 MILLION
IN RESERVE TO PREPARE FOR AN EVENTUALITY OF WHAT COULD
HAPPEN WITH THE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION CLAMPING DOWN A
CITY ACROSS THE COUNTRY. >> WE ALSO HELD MONEY
IN RESERVE FOR OUR CITY ATTORNEY'S OFFICE TO BE ABLE TO
LITIGATE AGAINST THE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION IN PREPARATION
TO BE PROACTIVE AND NOT JUST REACTIVE AGAINST WHAT WE'RE COMING DOWN FROM THREATS FROM THE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION.
>> AND THAT DILIGENCE AND PROACTIVE NESS AND ENSURING
THAT OUR CITY ATTORNEY HAS THE RESOURCES WE NEED IS OFTEN ONE
OF THE ONLY LINES OF DEFENSE THAT WE HAVE AGAINST THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. SO I THINK THE FORESIGHT OF THE
BUDGET COMMITTEE AND THE MAYOR'S OFFICE TO ENSURE THAT
WE ARE INVESTING IN THOSE RESOURCES IS A COMMENDABLE ACTION THAT WE WERE HAPPY TO ADVOCATE FOR FROM MY OFFICE BUT
ALSO REALLY GOES AGAIN TO THE BUDGET COMMITTEE AND THE
MAYOR'S OFFICE FOR LEADING THEIR.
I ALSO WANT TO COMMENT THAT WE ARE IN THIS BUDGET WE ARE
INCREASING FUNDING FOR THE IMMIGRATION LEGAL DEFENSE FUND
. IT'S ITEM 15 AND WHICH I WAS HAPPY TO CO-SPONSOR WITH THE PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE.
AND SO I THINK ESPECIALLY MISSED THIS HISTORIC BUDGET
DEFICIT. THE FACT THAT WE WERE ABLE TO GET THE GOVERNMENT WORKING TOGETHER WITH COMMUNITY
AND NONPROFITS IN THE CITY TO INVEST WHERE WE NEED TO TO ADD
MORE MORE ATTORNEYS TO THE PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE IS AN IMPORTANT INVESTMENT THAT WE'RE MAKING THAT WAS PART OF THE
TRAILING LANDS THAT WE'RE GOING TO VOTE ON AS WELL.
AND I WOULD HOPE THAT WE COULD MAYBE COVER THAT ITEM ITEM 15
SO I CAN HOPE THAT WE GOT A UNANIMOUS SUPPORT TO SHOW THAT
THE BOARD IS COMMITTED TO IMMIGRATION, DEFENSE AND ALLOW
PEOPLE TO VOTE HOLISTICALLY HOW THEY'D LIKE ON THE REGULAR BUDGET. BUT AT LEAST SHOWS A MESSAGE
FROM THE CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO THAT AN ITEM 15 TO
SUPPORT IMMIGRATION LEGAL DEFENSE THAT WE ARE UNANIMOUS
IN OUR SUPPORT FOR HIRING ATTORNEYS INTO THE PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE AND ENSURE THAT THEY THEY KNOW THAT WE
HAVE THEIR BACK IN THIS VERY DIFFICULT TIME.
THANK YOU. SUPERVISOR MAHMUD THANK YOU COLLEAGUES. >> WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO VOTE
ON THIS STUFF AFTER THE TWO THREE SPECIAL ACCOMMODATIONS
BECAUSE IT GOT MUCH MORE COMPLICATED THAN I IMAGINED IT
WAS. IT WAS GOING TO BE JUST
SUPERVISOR ONE. WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, PRESIDENT MALAMAN Y JUST THAT IT IS GOING TO TAKE WE HAVE A NUMBER OF
PEOPLE WAITING FOR THIS 230 SPECIAL COMMENDATIONS INCLUDING HARVEY ROSE AND WHAT I THOUGHT WAS GOING TO BE A RELATIVELY
QUICK VOTE ON A BUNCH OF ITEMS AND A LONGER CONVERSATION ABOUT
ONE OF THE ITEMS HAS TURNED INTO A NUMBER OF SEPARATE
VOTES. SO I'M INCLINED TO PUT THAT OVER UNTIL AFTER THE 230 SPECIAL ORDER.
I WOULD LIKE TO ALSO ECHO THE THANKS OF MY COLLEAGUES FOR OUR
BUDGET CHAIR CHAIR CHAN, FOR THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. >> I THINK THIS WAS A
HISTORICALLY DIFFICULT BUDGET. I THINK IT IS A HARD THING FOR
THE BUDGET CHAIR TO ACCOMMODATE THE PREFERENCES OF A MAJORITY
OF A BOARD OF SUPERVISORS THAT DOES NOT ALL INDIVIDUALLY SEE
PRIORITIES THE SAME WAY DOES NOT RANK ITEMS IN THE SAME WAY
. WHAT MAY BE SELF-EVIDENT TO ONE SUPERVISOR MAY BE ANATHEMA TO ANOTHER SUPERVISOR AND THAT WAS
THE WORLD THAT SUPERVISOR CHAN AND HER STAFF THANK YOU FRANCIS
SHEA AND OTHERS FOUND AND I THINK DID FROM MY PERSPECTIVE
GREAT WORK IN TRYING TO HONESTLY AND IN A COLLEGIAL WAY
ACCOMMODATE AS MANY PERSPECTIVES AS MANY VIEWS
AND SATISFIES AS BEST AS BEST COULD BE DONE.
THE OTHER THING THAT I REALLY APPRECIATE ABOUT THE WAY THE
CHAIR RAN THIS PROCESS IS THAT IT KEPT THE ERA OF COOPERATION
BETWEEN OUR MAYOR AND OUR BOARD OF SUPERVISORS GOING.
THERE WERE SOME WHO SAID THAT THE GOOD VIBES OF THE EARLIER
PART OF THE YEAR SURELY WOULD NOT SURVIVE OUR BUDGET.
THIS BOARD DID NOT LEAVE THE MAYOR'S BUDGET UNTOUCHED.
WE CHANGED THINGS THAT WERE IMPORTANT.
WE ASKED FOR A COMPROMISE FROM THE MAYOR.
THE MAYOR GAVE COMPROMISE AND I THINK IN SOME WAYS PERHAPS
RESET SOME OF THE RELATIONSHIPS WITH SOME OF THE FOLKS ON THE BOARD. I HOPE AND I THINK THERE WERE
OPPORTUNITIES FOR COOPERATION WHICH WE WE TOOK AND HE TOOK
AND AND THAT IS LARGELY THROUGH THE LEADERSHIP OF OUR CHAIR.
SO THANKS TO YOUR ACTION. THANKS MAYOR LURIE THANKS.
COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANKS TO ALL THE STAFFS IN MY CASE
ESPECIALLY BRADLEY PHELPS, THANKS TO ALL THE PEOPLE WHO
HAVE ALREADY BEEN THANKED. BUT THE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE,
THE BUDGET LEGISLATIVE ANALYST, OUR CLERK OF COURSE ANGELA
CALVILLO AND BRANT EPA AND OUR CITY ATTORNEY AND ALL THE OTHER
PEOPLE I'M FORGETTING TO MENTION NONE OF US ARE HAPPY
WITH THIS BUDGET. I DON'T THINK THE MAYOR IS HAPPY WITH THIS BUDGET. BUT YOU KNOW, WE ARE DOING THE
BEST WE CAN TO PROTECT THE CITY OUR CITY IN A DIFFICULT,
DIFFICULT TIME AND WE WILL WORK OUR WAY THROUGH A SET OF
COMPLICATED VOTES AFTER WE GO TO OUR 230 SPECIAL ORDER.
AND I WOULD NOTE THAT WE HAVE BEEN JOINED IN THE CHAMBER BY
TWO FORMER MEMBERS OF THIS BODY A STATE SENATOR AND FORMER
JUDGE AND FORMER MEMBER OF THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS QUENTIN
KOPP IS HERE AND OUR FORMER COLLEAGUE FORMER PRESIDENT THE
BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AARON PESKIN IS HERE. THERE'S QUENTIN KOPP AND AARON PESKIN A FEW SEATS BACK AARON
AND I THINK THEY MIGHT BE HERE FOR OUR FIRST CELEBRANT CELEBRE
ANYWAY, MADAM CLERK, COULD YOU PLEASE CALL OUR 230 SPECIAL
ORDER? >> YES, IT IS NOW TIME FOR THE
RECOGNITION OF COMMENDATIONS FOR MERITORIOUS SERVICE AND WITH DISTINCTION FOR TWO THE CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN
FRANCISCO ALL RIGHT, COLLEAGUES TAKING AS I USUALLY GO LAST I'M
GOING LAST ON MY NORMAL ACCOMMODATION BUT I HAVE A I DO
HAVE A THING FOR HARVEY ROSE SO I'M GOING TO PUT THE THING DOWN
WHILE I TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HARVEY ROSE WHILE ALL
COMMENDATIONS ARE SPECIAL TODAY WE HAVE ONE THAT IS MORE THAN MORE THAN A HALF A CENTURY IN THE MAKING ON BEHALF OF THE
FULL BOARD OF SUPERVISORS SUPERVISORS IT'S WITH GREAT
APPRECIATION THAT I AM GOING TO BE PRESENTING A RESOLUTION
COMMENDING AND HONORING HARVEY AND ROSE THAT WE ARE GOING TO
BE VOTING ON LATER TODAY. >> HE HAS SERVED WITH
DISTINCTION FOR MORE THAN FIVE DECADES AS THE BUDGET
AND LEGISLATIVE ANALYST FOR THE CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN
FRANCISCO. >> HARVEY THIS IS YOUR OPPORTUNITY TO STAND UP AND GET SOME APPLAUSE.
AND AS I SAID LATER IN TODAY'S MEETING WE'RE GOING TO BE VOTING TO PLACE INTO THE RECORD A RESOLUTION OFFICIALLY
AND FOREVER RECOGNIZING HARVEY'S PLACE IN SAN
FRANCISCO'S HISTORY AND CODIFYING HATCHETT HARVEY'S
CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR CITY. >> HARVEY ROSE WAS BORN
AND RAISED IN NUTLEY, NEW JERSEY.
HE ATTENDED RUTGERS UNIVERSITY AND LATER COMPLETED COLLEGE AT
THE UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI BEFORE BECOMING A CERTIFIED PUBLIC
ACCOUNTANT IN 1971. >> THIS BOARD OF SUPERVISORS
CHOSE HARVEY TO SERVE AS BUDGET ANALYST BUT FOR A SHORT STINT
AS THE STATE AUDITOR IN THE MID 1970S.
HARVEY SERVED IN THIS ROLE THROUGH JUNE SECOND OF THIS
YEAR. DURING HIS TENURE HE OVERSAW
THE EXPANSION OF THE OFFICE OF BUDGET BUDGET ANALYST IN RESPONSE TO REQUESTS FROM THIS BOARD FOR ADDITIONAL
INDEPENDENT REPORTS AND SERVICES INCLUDING
PERFORMANCE AUDITS, BUDGET ANALYZES ANALYSIS OF PROPOSED LEGISLATION WITH FISCAL IMPACT POLICY ANALYZES AND SUPPORT FOR
BOARD RESPONSES TO CIVIL GRAND JURY REPORTS.
HARVEY HAS CONDUCTED INDEPENDENT MANAGEMENT AUDITS
OF NEARLY EVERY DEPARTMENT AND KEY FUNCTION IN THE CITY,
ANALYZED AND MADE RECOMMENDATIONS ON 52 FISCAL
YEARS WORTH OF PROPOSED MAYOR'S BUDGETS AND PROPOSED THOUSANDS
OF LEGISLATIVE AND POLICY ANALYZES REPORTS ON EVERY KEY
FISCAL AND POLICY MATTER CONSIDERED BY THE BOARD. >> OBVIOUSLY THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVE WATCHED THE BOARD HAVE
SEEN HARVEY HARVEY IN ACTION. BUT FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO MAY
HAVE MISSED OUT ON THAT OPPORTUNITY, MADAM CLERK, CAN
YOU PLEASE ROLL THE TAPE AS IF LIVE TV PLEASE?
>> YOU KNOW, I'M NOT SO SURE WHY TODAY WE HAVE ALL THIS HOT
ISSUES BUT ANYWAY I'M THE COMPTROLLER IS NOW PROJECTING
THAT THE PUBLIC LIBRARY WILL HAVE A PROJECTED BUDGETARY
SHORTFALL OF 2.8 MILLION FOR THIS FISCAL YEAR AND THAT'S
BASED ON THE YEAR TO DATE EXPENDITURE PATTERNS. THIS REQUEST BEFORE YOU FROM A VARIETY OF SOURCES WOULD FUND
1,601,488 OF THAT SHORTFALL. >> THEREFORE IF YOU APPROVE
THIS SHORT FOR YOU WOULD STILL HAVE A PROJECTED BUDGETARY
SHORTFALL OF $1,278,259. AND THIS IS CLEARLY A CASE OF
OVERSPENDING IN BUDGETED TEMPORARY SALARIES, OVERTIME
PREMIUM PAY AS WELL AS THE RELATED FRINGE BENEFITS THAT'S
CLEARLY ILLUSTRATED BY THE CONTROLLERS SCHEDULE.
>> WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IS THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE BACK
HERE AND MR. ROSENBLATT LEFT BECAUSE HE'S BEEN AROUND LONGER THAN I. A YEAR FROM NOW, 18 MONTHS FROM NOW AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A HUGE COST TO THE INDIGENT
DEFENSE. WE'RE NOT LOOKING AT THE WHOLE COST OF INDIGENT DEFENSE HOLISTICALLY.
>> BUT LET'S HEAR FROM HARVEY. HARVEY ROSE TO SAY THE LEAST. I AM A LITTLE FRUSTRATED AT THIS ITEM AND I'M FRUSTRATED
BECAUSE THE PUBLIC DEFENDER HAS CONSTANTLY DURING THE COURSE OF
OUR PREPARING OUR DRAFT REPORTS AND SUBMITTING IT TO THE PUBLIC
DEFENDER HAS CONSTANTLY CHANGED HIS POSITION. LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE. JUST TODAY IN HIS TESTIMONY HE
SAID TO YOU THAT IF HE GOES TO THE BAR ASSOCIATION HE'S GOING
TO HAVE TO SPEND $120 AN HOUR. YET IN HIS WRITTEN MEMO TO OUR
OFFICE WHICH IS ATTACHED TO OUR REPORT, HE STATED THAT THE
HOURLY RATE WOULD BE 85 TO 100 AND $20 AN HOUR.
THAT'S JUST ONE TINY EXAMPLE OF THE INCONSISTENCIES AND THE THE
SPIN THAT THE PUBLIC DEFENDER HAS PUT ON THIS I SAYING MY
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE EXTENSION THAT WE'RE APPROVING GOES BACK TO OCTOBER 1ST OF 2008.
>> WE'RE TALKING ABOUT LATE JANUARY.
WHY WHY ARE WE WAITING SO LONG TO DO SOMETHING INVOLVING, YOU
KNOW, PRETTY LARGE AMOUNT OF MONEY? >> WELL, I, I AGREE WITH YOU, SUPERVISOR CAMPOS AND THAT'S
WHY WE CALLED IT OUT IN OUR REPORT.
THE DEPARTMENT INADVERTENTLY DID NOT PROVIDE PAYMENTS FOR
OCTOBER NOVEMBER OF 2008. AND SO THEY THEY STARTED TO
EXPEND THE MONEY. BUT I, I, I FULLY AGREE WITH
YOU THAT IT SHOULD NOT HAVE RETROACTIVITY IS TO THE EXTENT
POSSIBLE SHOULD NOT BE DONE AND EVERY TIME THAT HAPPENS WE
POINT THAT OUT TO THE BOARD AND RECOMMEND THAT THE
LEGISLATION SHOULD BE AMENDED APPROPRIATELY. WE RECOMMEND ELIMINATING POSITIONS AND IN SOME CASES
ADJUSTING ATTRITION SAVINGS TO DO JUST WHAT THE DIRECTOR SAYS
TO BRING EVERYTHING INTO ALIGNMENT. AND SO WE'LL LOOK AT ANY NEW INFORMATION THEY CAN PROVIDE
THAT WE DON'T BELIEVE THERE IS ANY WAY THAT THESE
RECOMMENDATIONS WILL RESULT IN LAYOFFS. >> BUT LET ME MAKE ONE OTHER COMMENT, MADAM CHAIR.
THIS THIS BUDGET CONTRARY TO WHAT I'VE TESTIFIED BEFORE ON
SOME OTHER BUDGETS WHICH I'VE ARGUED THAT THE BUDGETS HAVE
GONE UP IN OUR RECOMMENDATIONS JUST LOWERED IN FACT WE AGREE
THIS BUDGET HAS GONE DOWN. BUT THINK ABOUT IT THERE IS
NOTHING MAGIC ABOUT THE MAYOR SENDING OVER.
>> BUT WHEN THE MAYOR SENDS OVER BUDGET AND HE REDUCES THAT
BUDGET, THAT DOESN'T MAKE THE MAYOR'S BUDGET WHICH IS DOWN
PERFECT. >> IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THERE
CAN BE SIMPLY BECAUSE THERE HAVE BEEN CUTS. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THERE CAN BE OTHER CUTS WITHOUT IMPAIRING
SERVICE LEVELS AND THAT'S THE ARGUMENT AND WE'LL CERTAINLY
WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT THIS WEEK. BUT WHAT MR. BRUCE IS TELLING YOU IS THEY'VE OVERACHIEVED
THEIR SALARY SAVINGS AND OUR RECOMMENDATIONS DO NOT RESULT
IN SERVICE REDUCTIONS. >> NOW MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS
OF THE COMMITTEE LET ME MAKE JUST ONE OTHER COMMENT AND THEN
I'LL START MY RECOMMENDATIONS AND MY COMMENT IS THIS
REPEATEDLY OR HISTORICALLY SUPERVISORS IN COMMENTING ON
OUR ANNUAL RECOMMENDATIONS TO REDUCE THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC
HEALTH BUDGET, THE DEPARTMENT HAS REPEATEDLY STATED THAT ANY
CUTS MADE BY THE BUDGET ANALYST WOULD RESULT IN SEVERE SERVICE
REDUCTIONS. FOR EXAMPLE IN THIS VERY
CURRENT YEAR 2001 2002 THE BUDGET ANALYST RECOMMENDED
REDUCTIONS TO THE FINANCE COMMITTEE OF 795,009 65 BUT THE
BOARD OF SUPERVISORS ACCEPTED ONLY 204,007 88 OF THE BUDGET
ANALYST RECOMMENDATIONS BASED ON THE TESTIMONY BY THE
DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH THAT THE DEPARTMENT COULD NOT
ABSORB THE BUDGET ANALYST'S RECOMMENDATIONS WITHOUT
RESULTING IN SERIOUS SERVICE REDUCTIONS.
I CALLED MR. ROSENFELD YESTERDAY AND HE ADVISED ME
THAT TO PARTIALLY RESOLVE THIS FISCAL YEAR 2001 22 BUDGET
DEFICIT, THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH PROVIDED $5
MILLION IN SAVINGS NOT 795,000 THAT WE RECOMMENDED BUT $5
MILLION. SO FRANKLY I GET A LITTLE TIRED EACH YEAR WE HEAR THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH
TELLING THIS BOARD IS IT? >> BUT I REALIZE IT'S A TOTAL
POLICY MATTER IF THE BOARD DOES NOT ACCEPT OUR RECOMMENDATIONS
. BUT WHAT I GET TIRED OF IS A DEPARTMENT HEAD TELLING A BOARD OF SUPERVISORS HEARS ABOUT THE
SEVERE SERVICE REDUCTIONS THAT ARE GOING TO RESULT FROM FROM
THE IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR RECOMMENDATIONS ADVISING THEM
ON THE ONE HAND THEY ADVISE THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS THAT THEY
CAN'T ABSORB THE BUDGET UNLESS RECOMMENDATIONS BUT ON THE OTHER HAND SOMEHOW THIS DEPARTMENT IS THE FIRST ONE TO
COME FORWARD TO HELP THE MAYOR RESOLVE A BUDGET CRISIS.
>> SUPERVISORS. I ASSURE YOU THAT THE
DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH IS NO DIFFERENT THAN ANY OTHER
DEPARTMENT IN THIS CITY AND COUNTY. THERE IS FAT IN THE DEPARTMENTS BUDGET AND OUR RECOMMENDATIONS
ARE TO ELIMINATE THAT FAT AND ARE NOT MADE TO CAUSE ANY
SERVICE REDUCTIONS TO THE CITY'S HEALTH DELIVERY SYSTEM.
>> MR. ROSE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS THAT CORRECT?
>> AUDITOR GENERAL'S CALIFORNIA THAT IS CORRECT.
>> AND YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE AIRPORT BOTH BY DOING ITS
OPERATING BUDGETS FOR THE LAST THREE DECADES AS WELL AS THE
MANAGEMENT AUDIT AND OTHER SCOPES OF WORK THAT YOU'VE
PERFORMED OVER THAT PERIOD OF TIME? >> WE ARE ALSO FAMILIAR WITH OTHER AIRPORTS THROUGHOUT THE
COUNTRY WITH RESPECT TO THE WORK THAT WE'VE DONE. >> CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT THE ADDED VALUE OF HAVING AN
INDEPENDENT AUDIT THAT IS NOT PAID FOR BY OR INSTRUCTED BY THE AIRPORT BUT INSTEAD BY AN INDEPENDENT PARTY SUCH AS
YOURSELF IN DOING SUCH AN AUDIT?
>> WELL, SUPERVISOR I'M GLAD YOU ASKED ME THAT QUESTION BECAUSE FORGETTING ABOUT ME OR MY FIRM OR THE BUDGET ANALYST
AS THE FORMER AUDITOR GENERAL, AS A FORMER SUPERVISOR FOR THE
UNITED STATES GENERAL ACCOUNTING OFFICE HAVING THE
AIRPORT RETAIN AND PAY FOR A MANAGEMENT AUDIT AS FAR AS I'M
CONCERNED IS A TOTAL WASTE DEFIANCE.
>> IT'S A SHAM AND THERE IS NO WAY THAT THAT CAN BE AN
INDEPENDENT MANAGEMENT OF IT BY HAVING THE AIRPORT RETAIN THE
OUTSIDE ORDER. I WOULD URGE THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS TO TAKE ME OUT OF THE PICTURE SOMEHOW CREATE
LEGISLATION IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT. I MEAN WE'D LOVE TO DO THE AUDIT BUT IF THAT'S WHAT YOU
WANT HIRE SOMEONE ELSE NOT ME UNDER THE AUSPICES OF THE BOARD
OF SUPERVISORS TO DO A MANAGEMENT AUDIT.
THAT'S THE ONLY WAY YOU'RE GOING TO GET AN INDEPENDENT MANAGEMENT AUDIT THIS IS LIKE THE FOX WATCHING THE CHICKEN
COOP FOR THE AIRPORT TO RETAIN A PERFORMANCE OR MANAGEMENT
AUDIT. >> HOW MUCH WOULD AN AUDIT LIKE THIS COST IN THE INDUSTRY OF A OF AN ORGANIZATION OF THIS SIZE
IN THE INDUSTRY IN ORDER OF THIS MAGNITUDE WILL PROBABLY IF
IT'S A TRUE COMPREHENSIVE MANAGEMENT AUDIT IT WOULD
PROBABLY BE UPWARDS OF $800,000 WOULD BE MY ESTIMATE.
>> THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. OH YES MADAM CHAIR OF THE
COMMITTEE. I SAID I DIDN'T WANT TO COME ON
IN EACH DEPARTMENT BUT LET ME JUST MAKE ONE COMMENT. IF MR. RAU DOES NOT HAVE A SURPLUS IN THIS COMING YEAR I
WILL EAT HIS BUDGET. >> THE ACTUAL BOOK WITH KETCHUP
PRICES. >> OKAY. I'VE HEARD THAT. I'VE HEARD THAT BEFORE AND SO
WHAT I SAID WHAT I SAID WELL WE WILL NOT HAVE AN $8 MILLION
SALARY SURPLUS AT THE END OF THE YEAR SO YOU WILL HAVE A
SURPLUS AND THAT MEANS THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS COULD TAKE
SOME ADDITIONAL FUNDS THIS IS THAT CORRECT? >> THE SURPLUS IS NOT GOING TO BE ANOTHER 1.4 MILLION ABOVE
THE 4.0. >> UNDERSTOOD. UNDERSTOOD THE WHAT WOULD IT BE ?
>> MR. MOORE THAT'S DIFFICULT TO PROJECT. MR. ROSE I CAN'T PROJECT BUT IT WOULD BE SOMETHING YOU JUST
SAID THAT THERE WILL BE A SURPLUS.
>> SURE. LET'S LET'S PICK A NUMBER. YOU WANT TO PICK IT OUT IN THE HALF, THE MORE THINGS CHANGE,
THE MORE THEY STAY THE SAME. >> WE WANT TO THANK OUR
OPERATIONS DEPUTY FOR THE BOARD WILSON ING AND MICHAEL
BALTAZAR, ANSON AND JACK CHIN FROM S.F. GOV TV FOR CREATING
THAT TRIBUTE VIDEO. I KNOW WE HAVE SOME DIGNITARIES
IN THE AUDIENCE WHO WOULD LIKE THE PRIVILEGE OF THE FLOOR BUT
BEFORE WE GET TO THEM I HAVE SOME COLLEAGUES WHO'D LIKE TO SAY SOME THINGS. >> SUPERVISOR WALTON THANK YOU
PRESIDENT MALAMAN OBVIOUSLY I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR KEEPING
US ON TASK, HARI AND FOR MAKING SURE THAT THIS BODY IS FISCALLY
RESPONSIBLE WHEN WE MAKE DECISIONS. BUT ALSO LIKE I SAID AT THE LAST BUDGET AN APPROPRIATIONS
COMMITTEE MEETING I THINK THAT THE COMMUNITY OWES A LOT OF
GRATITUDE TO YOU AND YOUR TEAM AS WE GO THROUGH WHAT WE CALL
THE AIR BAG PROCESS. YOU ARE THE ONE THAT IS
RESPONSIBLE FOR FINDING ALL OF THE FAT, ALL OF THE WASTE THAT
EXISTS IN GOVERNMENT AND THOSE RESOURCES COME BACK TO THE
BOARD SO THAT WE CAN GIVE THEM TO COMMUNITY. AND SO I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE COMMUNITY KNOWS
AND UNDERSTANDS THAT AS THEY WERE ABLE TO SEE SOME OF YOUR
WORK THROUGH THE VIDEO BUT YOU HAVE SAVED SOME CRITICAL
SERVICES FOR THIS CITY YEAR AFTER YEAR DURING THAT PROCESS
AND DEFINITELY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE THANK YOU FOR THAT. I THINK FOR ME FROM A FROM A
PERSONAL STANDPOINT IT'S GOING TO BE A LITTLE DIFFERENT WHEN I
WALK IN HERE ON A TUESDAY AFTER FOR ANOTHER GAME AND I DON'T
HAVE A CHANCE TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH YOU ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENED ON THAT SUNDAY OR WHAT HAPPENED ON THAT MONDAY.
BUT I DO APPRECIATE THE WAY YOU WORK THE FACT THAT YOU
UNDERSTOOD THE ASSIGNMENT AND UNDERSTOOD WHAT YOUR ROLE
WAS AND THAT YOU DID NOT BACK DOWN TO ANY CITY DEPARTMENT OR
NOT BACK DOWN TO QUITE FRANKLY ANY MAYOR'S ADMINISTRATION
AND JUST APPRECIATE WATCHING YOU AND I RESPECT YOUR WORK
AND YOU ARE GOING TO BE MISSED HERE AT THIS BOARD OF
SUPERVISORS. BUT I DO WISH YOU THE BEST
AND WHATEVER YOU DECIDE TO DO IN YOUR RETIREMENT BUT THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR MANY DECADES OF SERVICE SURPRISE
MELGAR THANK YOU. PRESIDENT MANDELL I HAVE SO
MUCH TO SAY BUT I WILL KEEP IT SHORT AND I I'M OG HERE AND I
HAVE SO MUCH RESPECT AND ADMIRATION FOR MR. HARVEY
ROSE IN 1997. I WAS A BUDGET I MEAN I WAS A
BABY LEGISLATIVE ANALYST ALONG WITH A CLERK.
CALVO BEFORE DISTRICT ELECTIONS I WAS AN AIDE TO SUPERVISOR
MEDINA AND CLARK CALVILLO WAS AN AIDE TO TOM AMMIANO AND MR.
ROSE WENT TO FOUND OUT THAT SAME YEAR THAT BARBARA KAUFMAN
WAS PRESIDENT HIS FIRM YOU KNOW HARVEY ROSEN ASSOCIATES
AND STARTED WHAT BECAME AN AMAZING CAREER HELPING US TAKE
IT UP TO THE LEVEL THAT WE NOW HAVE TODAY TO SUPPORT BILLIONS
OF DOLLARS IN OUR BUDGET BEING SPENT WITH OVERSIZE WITH KEEN
ANALYSIS CALLING BIAS WHEN YOU NEED BUT ALSO SUPPORTING US
IN BEING ABLE TO ANALYZE PROPERLY AND TAKE IT ALL
IN CONTEXT. YOU'VE ALSO MANAGED TO MENTOR A
WHOLE GENERATION OF FOLKS WHO YOU LEAVE BEHIND WHO ARE
TRAINED TO CONTINUE HELPING US DO THE SAME AND I DO NOT TAKE
THAT LIGHTLY BECAUSE YOUR STAFF IS AMAZING AND YOU HAVE LEFT
THAT FOR US AS WELL. ON A PERSONAL NOTE, I HAVE VERY
MUCH APPRECIATED GETTING TO KNOW YOU AND YOUR WIFE RENE WE
HAVE A PERSONAL CONNECTION AND I HAVE JUST SO APPRECIATE
ADDED YOU IN MY LIFE AND WILL CONTINUE TO SEE YOU OUTSIDE
THIS HALL BUT I CANNOT THANK YOU ENOUGH FOR EVERYTHING
YOU'VE GIVEN US OUR CITY THE FOLKS THAT YOU HAVE TOUCHED
AND TRAINED IN YOUR AMAZING BRAIN IN WHAT IT HAS LEFT YOU
KNOW AS A MARK IN OUR CITY. >> THANK YOU SO MUCH.
SUPERVISE HER AND BUDGET CHAIR CHAN THANK YOU IN HARVEY I SAID
THIS MR. ROSS I SAID THIS WHEN WE KICK OFF OUR BUDGET THAT
GENERATION IN SAN FRANCISCANS DID NOT KNOW YOUR NAME BUT
REALLY YOU HAVE SERVED THEM REALLY WELL AND YOU LAY A SOLID
FOUNDATION FOR GENERATIONS OF SERVICES TO COME THAT THEY WILL
HAVE A CITY GOVERNMENT WITH YOUR TEAM THAT YOU LEFT BEHIND
AND MENTORED AND TRAINED THAT WE WILL HAVE A CITY GOVERNMENT
THAT HAS INTEGRITY MOST OF ALL IN CITY SERVICES, THAT HAS
ACCOUNTABILITY AND CONTINUING JUST MAKING SURE THAT WE
DELIVER FOR SAN FRANCISCANS AND AND THAT TRULY THAT IS YOUR
LEGACY AND I CANNOT WAIT TO SEE WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO NEXT.
THANK YOU, COLLEAGUES. AS I SAID, SOME OF THE 90
MEMBERS OF THE ROUGHLY 90 MEMBERS OF THE BOARD WHO HARVEY
ROSE HAS SIR, TO WHOM HARVEY ROSAS HAS SERVED AS A TRUSTED
ADVISOR HAVE SHOWED UP TODAY AND I WOULD ASK COLLEAGUES
WITHOUT OBJECTION THAT WE GRANT THE PRIVILEGE OF THE FLOOR TO
QUENTIN L KOPP, WHO SERVED FOUR TERMS AS A MEMBER OF THE SAN FRANCISCO BOARD OF SUPERVISORS, THEN WENT ON TO THE CALIFORNIA
STATE SENATE AND SERVED AS A SUPERIOR COURT JUDGE.
>> NOW RETIRED JUDGE COP THANK YOU MR. PRESIDENT.
I STAND HERE AS ONE OF THE FEW LIVING APOSTLES OF GOOD
GOVERNMENT IN SAN FRANCISCO WHO WAS ON THE SCENE IN 1971 WHEN
HARVEY M ROSE ARRIVED FROM LOS ANGELES.
IT WAS CLAIMED THAT NO ONE HAD EVER HEARD OF THE BUDGET
ANALYSTS. >> THEN 1971 AND EVEN HARVEY'S
FATHER WHO WAS VISITING AND STROLLING DOWNTOWN ASKED
PEOPLE IF THEY KNEW THE BUDGET ANALYSTS WAS AND NOBODY DID.
I COULD ALWAYS COUNT ON HARVEY TO ASK ME FOR MANY THINGS BUT
PRIMARILY SUPERBOWL TICKETS AND FORTUNATELY A FELLOW
DARTMOUTH ALUMNUS WAS PRESIDENT OF THE CINCINNATI BENGALS AND I
WOULD BOTHER HIM FOR SUPER BOWL TICKETS FOR THE ENTIRE ROSE
ENTOURAGE AND OCCASIONALLY IF I GOT TO THE SUPER BOWL BY LET'S
SAY FRIDAY BEFORE THE SUNDAY GAME I MIGHT GET A DINNER OUT
OF RED FROM THE BELOVED BUDGET ANALYST HE LOVED EVERY ONE OF
NINE MEMBERS WHO CREATED A CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO
BUDGET FROM JOSEPH LAWRENCE ALIOTO TO GEORGE MOSCONI TO
DIANNE FEINSTEIN DIAGNOSED TO FRANK JORDAN TO WILLIE BROWN TO
GAVIN NEWSOM TO A LONDON BREED AND NOW THE HONORABLE DANIEL
LURIE. THE ONLY FINANCIAL PROBLEM HE
COULDN'T ANALYZE WAS THE STOCK MARKET.
BUT HIS LOYAL WIFE RENE AND SHE IS LOYAL NEVER COMPLAINED.
SO AS THE DRUGS AS HE USED TO DO EVERY MORNING WITH THE THEN
COMPTROLLER JOHN FARRELL, SENIOR WHICH HE ALSO CALLS HOME
IN THE SUNSET WE SAY MAZEL DRIVE CONGRATULATE ME ON A LONG
ACCOMPLISHED CAREER AND THANK YOU FROM A TAX PAYERS OF THE
CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO AND ALL OF THE
SUPERVISORS FROM RON PELOSI AND BOB MANUEL AND JANELLE
MOLINARI AND JOHN JAY BARBER JALOTA AND TERRY FRANZ TO AARON
PESKIN WHO IS IN THE CHAMBERS TODAY AND I THINK WILL REGALE
US WITH MORE UP TO DATE TALES OF THE BUDGET ANALYZE OUR
REASONS DALLAS'S BUDGET ENABLED US FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE
HISTORY OF THE CITY AND COUNTY TO SPEND MONEY WITHOUT ENJOYING
IT. >> ARE WE TO SAY IF IT DOES
FROM BREAKDOWNS AND ENABLED SAN FRANCISCO CITIZENS TO PAY AS
THEY GO AND THEY DIDN'T GO ANYWHERE HERE WITHOUT HARVEY'S
BENEDICTION, HIS MARKSMANSHIP ALWAYS ENABLED THE CITY
AND COUNTY NOT TO KEEP TAX PAYERS FROM BEING AFFECTED WITH
SO ABILITY BY MAYORS AND ALSO PROVIDE SOLUTIONS AND AT THE
MOMENT IN HISTORY WHICH IS BEING RECORDED TODAY IN A WAY
WHICH IS DESERVED BY THE FIRST AND THE ONLY BUDGET ANALYST
IN THE ANNALS OF THE CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO.
>> CONGRATULATIONS AND THANK YOU.
>> THANK YOU JUDGE COP I WOULD NOW LIKE TO INVITE A FORMER
BOARD PRESIDENT AARON PESKIN TO COME ON UP, CATCH UP AND RELISH
. >> HOW MANY TIMES DID WE HEAR IN THESE CHAMBERS THAT HE WOULD EAT A REPORT WITH KETCHUP?
>> I NEVER ACTUALLY SAW IT BUT I DID RELISH THE REPORTS THAT
HARVEY WOULD ISSUE AND I WANT TO ACTUALLY THANK JUDGE KOPP
AND THE BOARD OF THAT DAY OVER A HALF A CENTURY AGO, 54 YEARS
AGO OF HAVING THE POLICY IDEA OF ARMING THE LEGISLATIVE
BRANCH WITH A TRULY IN-DEPTH PENDENT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET
ANALYST MOST OTHER COUNTIES MOST OTHER BOARDS OF
SUPERVISORS DO NOT BENEFIT FROM THAT.
SO THANK YOU JUDGE KOPP FOR HAVING THE PRESENCE OF MIND TO
DO IT AND THANK YOU HARVEY AMBROSE FOR DOING IT ALL THESE
YEARS AND TO YOUR GENERATIONS OF STAFF SOME OF WHOM ARE DEPARTMENT HEADS AND CFOS WITHIN THIS GOVERNMENT, OUTSIDE
OF THIS GOVERNMENT THANK YOU TO RENE AND YOUR FAMILY FOR
PUTTING UP WITH YOU AND ALL OF US THIS HALF A CENTURY.
>> AND I WANT TO SAY THAT THAT REPORT THAT YOU SAW ME ASKING
ABOUT WE ACTUALLY DID GET AND BOY DID Y RELISH THAT
REPORT. >> IT SHOWED IMMEDIATELY AND HARVEY WAS HARVEY ON MY FIRST DAY SAID TO ME YOU CAN
COUNT ON ME TO BE INDEPENDENT AND NOT TO BOW DOWN TO OR
KOWTOW TO MAYORS OR MEMBERS OF YOUR BODY.
>> I'M AN UMPIRE I WILL CALL IT AS I SEE IT AND BOY WAS WILLIE
LOUIS BROWN AT HIM WHEN HE ISSUED A REPORT THAT SHOWED HOW
MUCH OF A BOONDOGGLE THE AIRPORT RUNWAY PROJECT WAS
AND AFTER THAT REPORT CAME OUT FRONT PAGE TOP OF THE PHONE,
SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE THEY WERE SPENDING MONEY FOR THOUSAND DOLLAR NIGHT HOTEL ROOMS AND $10,000 DINNERS.
I KID YOU NOT HE HELD NOTHING BACK AND WE MANAGED TO AVOID A
FINANCIALLY AND ENVIRONMENTALLY CATASTROPHIC BOONDOGGLE.
>> THANK YOU HARVEY ROSE FOR THAT.
>> HARVEY IT HAS REALLY BEEN A PLEASURE WORKING WITH YOU.
YOUR SENSE OF HUMOR AND I JUST WANT TO SAY I NOW FORGIVE YOU
FOR MISSING THAT ONE EXTRA DEPUTY DEPARTMENT HEAD POSITION
THAT WILLIE BROWN SLIPPED INTO THE PORT COMMISSION'S BUDGET
WHICH I FOUND AND YOU DIDN'T YOU ARE FORGIVEN.
>> AND WITH THAT UNLESS THERE ARE MEMBERS FORMER MEMBERS OF
THIS BODY IN THE CHAMBER WHO I AM NOT SEEING IT IS MY GREAT
THOUGH BITTERSWEET HONOR TO CALL UPON YOU ONE LAST TIME
IN YOUR CAPACITY AS BUDGET AND LEGISLATIVE ANALYST HARVEY
ROSE TO PROVIDE THE ROSE REPORT .
HARVEY THE FLOOR IS YOURS PRESIDENT MAILMAN AND MEMBERS
OF THE BOARD I'M SORRY PRESIDENT THEY HAD A LET OF
MEMBERS OF THE BOARD. I WILL MAKE THIS SHORT, SWEET
AND SIMPLE. I CANNOT ADEQUATELY EXPRESS
IN WORDS WHAT A TREMENDOUS HONOR AND PRIVILEGE IT HAS BEEN
FOR ME TO HAVE SERVED THE SAN FRANCISCO BOARD OF SUPERVISORS
FOR 52 YEARS AS THEIR BUDGET ANALYST.
>> AS A MATTER OF FACT, PRESIDENT MAGNUM AND I AM SO
OLD I KNEW BASKIN-ROBBINS IS WHEN THEY ONLY HAVE TWO FLAVORS
. BUT SERIOUSLY I WANT TO THANK EACH MEMBER OF THE BOARD AND ALL OF YOU FOR YOUR VERY
KIND COMMENTS. I'M NOT SURE THAT I DESERVE THEM. I CAN'T THANK FORMER SUPERVISOR
QUENTIN KOPP AND AARON PESKIN FOR THEIR KIND COMMENTS.
THEY WERE TWO GREAT OUTSTANDING SUPERVISORS WHO I HAVE ALWAYS
HAD THE HIGHEST RESPECT AS I'VE HAD THE HIGHEST RESPECT FOR THE
ENTIRE BOARDS OF SUPERVISORS THAT I HAVE SERVED.
I ALSO WANT TO THANK MY FAMILY AND FRIENDS WHO ARE HERE TODAY.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR FOR BEING HERE.
I AM HONORED I AM SO GRATEFUL TO EACH OF YOU.
THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU WITH WITHOUT HARVEY, I'M GOING TO INVITE YOU TO COME

I'LL START AS YOU MAKE YOUR WAY. IT IS WITH DEEP ADMIRATION AND GRATITUDE THAT I PRESENT
THIS COMMENDATION TODAY TO A GROUP OF NEIGHBORS WHOSE
VISION, GRIT AND PERSEVERANCE TURNS TURNED A ONCE OVERLOOKED
HILLSIDE INTO A VIBRANT WORK OF PUBLIC ART AND REFLECTION.
>> WE HONOR THE GARDEN AND NEIGHBORS GROUP FOR THEIR
COMMITMENT TO TRANSFORMING THE STAIRWAY AT GOTTEN JEAN
AND DWIGHT STREET INTO WHAT IS NOW LOVINGLY KNOWN AS THE STEPS TO WISDOM. >> THIS JOURNEY BEGAN NEARLY 20
YEARS AGO EARLY IN THE EARLY 2000S WHEN A SIMPLE
NEIGHBORHOOD CLEANUP EFFORT LED BY ABOUT TEN RESIDENTS DECIDED
TO CARE FOR AND BEAUTIFY THE BLOCK THEY CALL HOME.
THEY RECEIVED A SMALL GRANT TO CLEAN UP THE OVERGROWN HILL
AND FROM THERE THE CITY CONNECTED THEM WITH THE SAN
FRANCISCO PARKS ALLIANCE LAUNCHING A LONG TERM EFFORT TO
REIMAGINE WHAT THIS SPACE COULD MEAN FOR THE COMMUNITY.
>> IT WAS NOT AN EASY PROCESS. THE GROUP FACED RED TAPE
SETBACKS AND RESISTANCE AND TODAY ARE ALSO ONE OF THE
MANY GRASSROOTS GROUPS CAUGHT UP IN THE OF A MISMANAGEMENT.
BUT NEVERTHELESS THEY HAVE NEVER GIVEN UP.
IN 2019 THEY WERE AWARDED A COMMUNITY CHALLENGE GRANT
AND MOMENTUM GREW. THEY FUNDRAISE, COLLECTED
STORIES AND COLLABORATED WITH NEIGHBORS. YOUTH RETIRED AT HOMES AND COMMUNITY CENTERS TO GATHER
WORDS OF WISDOM, LIFE LESSONS, AFFIRMATIONS AND ADVICE THAT
ARE NOW ENGRAVED INTO THE TILES OF THESE BEAUTIFUL STEPS
DESIGNED BY ARTISTS. PHILIP GLASS HERE TODAY PHILLIP'S DESIGN IS A GRADIENT THAT MOVES FROM DARK TO LIGHT A
BEAUTIFUL METAPHOR FOR GROWTH AND HEALING.
>> AT THE TOP MIRRORED TILES REFLECT EACH VISITOR MAKING
THEM PART OF THE JOURNEY. THIS PROJECT IS MORE THAN
BEAUTIFICATION IT IS ABOUT RESILIENCE AND A LOVE FOR ONE'S
BLOCK AND NEIGHBORS. IT SHOWS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN
NEIGHBORS CLAIM A SPACE AND SHAPE IT WITH INTENTION
AND CONTINUE TO SHOW UP YEAR AFTER YEAR AND PERHAPS MOST
BEAUTIFULLY MANY OF THOSE WHO LED THIS PROJECT STILL LIVE ON
GOTTINGEN STREET REPRESENTING THE GROUP HERE TODAY IS PHILIP
HWA ERIC RUTENBERG, JEANETTE WRIGHT, LAURA CAMP AND MICHA

MAKE A LITTLE PART OF OUR NEIGHBORHOOD A LITTLE NICER.
OUR GROUP PARTNERED WITH THE SAN FRANCISCO PARKS ALLIANCE
IN 2006 TO HELP US FUNDRAISE AND CREATE A BEAUTIFUL SPACE
OUT OF A NEGLECTED HILLSIDE. WE SPENT OUR OWN FREE TIME
VOLUNTEERING TO CLEAN UP TRASH, PULL WEEDS, ORGANIZE PLANT
SALES AND OTHER FUNDRAISERS. >> COUNTLESS UNSEEN HOURS WERE
SPENT IN PLANNING AND ORGANIZING A 11 YEARS AFTER
AN IDEA TO BEAUTIFY THE STAIRS ON GOTTINGEN STREET, WE FINALLY
MANIFESTED THE STEPS TO WISDOM IN THE PORTOLA. I INVITE YOU ALL TO VISIT IT. WE DIDN'T DO IT ALONE.
WE HAD THE SUPPORT OF OUR COMMUNITY.
LOCAL BUSINESSES, FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS SUPERVISE OURS
INDIVIDUAL DONORS AVENUE GREENLIGHT AND THE COMMUNITY

,THE STORY ISN'T OVER THE GÃ–TTINGEN NEIGHBORS GROUP ALONG
WITH MANY OTHER COMMUNITY PARTNERS OF THE SAN FRANCISCO
PARKS ALLIANCE ARE NOW IN LIMBO REGARDING THE MONEY THAT WE
HAVE FUNDRAISED FOR OUR COMMUNITY PROJECTS BECAUSE OF
THE FINANCIAL MISMANAGEMENT OF THE SAN FRANCISCO PARKS ALLIANCE. WE THANK THE BOARD FOR
INVESTING GATING THIS ISSUE AND I SINCERELY HOPE THAT THESE
COMMUNITY GROUPS CAN SOMEHOW BE MADE WHOLE BECAUSE IF THESE
GROUPS ARE TO BE LEFT IN THE DUST I FEAR THE GOODWILL
AND COMMUNITY SPIRIT OF THESE GROUPS WILL DRY UP AND SAN
FRANCISCO WILL LOSE SO MANY COMMUNITY CIVIC PARTNERS THAT
HELP MAKE SAN FRANCISCO THE BEAUTIFUL AND MAGICAL PLACE
THAT IT IS TODAY. >> THANK YOU.

I'VE WORKED WITH AND THE COMMUNITY MEMBERS CBOS AND OF COURSE THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING AND DISABILITY SERVICES IT'S
BEEN A TRUE HONOR TO LIVE OUT WHAT I THINK IS MY PASSION
AND MY CALLING AND TO BE ABLE TO SERVE SAN FRANCISCO FOR OVER
35 YEARS IN DOING THAT AND WORKING IN MULTIPLE AREAS
HAS BEEN A TRUE HONOR AND A BLESSING TO ME AND YOU WILL
STILL BE SEEING ME AROUND. I'M GOING TO TAKE A LITTLE BREAK FOR A FEW YEARS, SPEND TIME WITH MY MOM WHILE I STILL

DISTRICT THREE SUPERVISOR SAUDER THANK YOU PRESIDENT
MENEM AND COLLEAGUES TODAY HAVE THE HONOR OF RECOGNIZING JOHN
ERICK KIM FORMALLY KNOWN AS CAPTAIN KIM NOW KNOWN AS
COMMANDER KEVIN KIM. COMMANDER, WOULD YOU COME ON UP
WITH THE REST OF YOUR TEAM, PLEASE?
WE HAVE BEEN SO LUCKY TO HAVE ERIC SERVE AS OUR CAPTAIN AT
CENTRAL STATION FOR THE PAST TWO YEARS. HIS TIME AS OUR CAPTAIN FOLLOWED NEARLY THREE DECADES
IN THE DEPARTMENT THAT HAS TAKEN HIM ACROSS TERRIBLE
INGLESIDE AND BAYVIEW STATIONS .
I STARTED TO GET TO KNOW COMMANDER KIM A FEW YEARS AGO
WHEN HE WAS NEW TO CENTRAL AND I WAS SERVING ON THE BOARD OF MY NEIGHBORHOOD ASSOCIATION AND SINCE THEN THERE'S A LOT
THAT I'VE ADMIRED ABOUT HIM. FIRST, HIS CANDOR AND HIS
HONESTY. I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MANY TIMES
HE SERVED A CONVERSATION WITH I'M JUST GOING TO TELL YOU HOW
IT IS. I'M JUST GOING TO BE HONEST WITH YOU. I'M GOING TO BE STRAIGHT WITH YOU. AND THAT'S THE SORT OF HONESTY AND TRANSPARENCY WE'VE NEEDED ESPECIALLY IN THESE LAST FEW
YEARS. HE IS BEEN VERY COMMITTED.
HE CONTINUES TO BE COMMITTED. HE'S ALWAYS AVAILABLE.
WE'VE HAD CONVERSATIONS EARLY IN THE MORNING, LATE AT NIGHT
AND I KNOW HE'S HAD THOSE SAME CONVERSATIONS WITH MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES AND MANY OTHER OF MY CONSTITUENTS.
I THINK MOST OF ALL THOUGH HE UNDERSTANDS THAT THIS IS A ROLE
THAT MUST BE DONE IN PARTNERSHIP WITH COMMUNITY
FOR IT TO BE DONE WELL. HE IS ALWAYS WILLING TO MEET
WITH COMMUNITY GROUPS LARGE AND SMALL, WILLING TO MEET WITH
CONSTITUENT WHO DESERVE AND NEED TO HEAR DIRECTLY FROM
A CAPTAIN AND DIRECTLY FROM THE POLICE DEPARTMENT.
HE'S ALSO DEDICATED TO FOOT PATROLS AND GETTING OFFICERS
OUT OF STATIONS INTO THE STREETS AND I APPRECIATE ALL OF
YOUR PARTNERSHIP IN DOING THAT IN OUR DISTRICT.
WE WILL MISS COMMANDER KIM THOUGH TO BE CLEAR, HE IS NOT RETIRING TO SPEND MORE TIME ATTENDING K-POP CONCERTS.
HE IS BEING PROMOTED TO COMMANDER OF METRO UNIT WHICH
MEANS WE WILL CONTINUE TO BENEFIT FROM HIS LEADERSHIP
AND HIS DEDICATION TO OUR CITY .
ERIC THANK YOU FOR ALL YOUR SERVICE AND IF YOU'D LIKE I
INVITE YOU TO SAY A FEW WORDS AND WHAT DO YOU WANT TO START
UP? I THANK YOU SUPERVISOR IT MEANS A LOT BEING RECOGNIZED FOR ALL THE WORK I DO WANT TO SAY THAT
BEING IN THE CAPTAIN OF CENTRAL STATION OR ANY OTHER STATION I
REALIZE THAT I DON'T KNOW THE SUCCESS OF A CAPTAIN NO MATTER
HOW HARD YOU WORK IT'S REALLY ABOUT BUILDING RELATIONSHIPS
AND GETTING SUPPORT FROM PEOPLE. SO I WANT TO TAKE THIS TIME TO THANK PEOPLE WHO MADE ME
SUCCESSFUL IN MY ROLE AND I FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO START BY
THANKING YOU SUPERVISOR BECAUSE I THINK EVEN BEFORE YOU BECAME
SUPERVISORS I KNOW WE MET AND WORKED TOGETHER WHEN HE WAS
A MEMBER OF THE NORTH BEACH NEIGHBORHOOD ASSOCIATION
AND THEN YOU CAME SUPERVISOR AND I REALLY WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT, YOUR LEADERSHIP AND I REALLY WANT TO
THANK ALSO YOUR STAFF BECAUSE TO BE VERY TRUTHFUL I KNOW WITH
ANY GREAT LEADER THE MOST IMPORTANT PEOPLE IS A STAFF.
THEY DO ALL THE WORK AND ALL THE TIME AND EFFORT SO I REALLY
WANT TO THANK THEM FOR THEIR PARTNERSHIP.
BUT ALSO A SUCCESSFUL CAPTAIN I BELIEVE IS WELL THE MEMBERS OF
THE COMMUNITY THEIR SUPPORT AND BESIDES THINKING THERE ARE
SO MANY COMMITTEE GROUPS IN THE CENTRAL THAT I'M VERY GRATEFUL BUT I SEE ONE HERE IN THE AUDIENCE TODAY ANY CHILD FROM
THE SELF-HELP FOR THE ELDERLY A GREAT ORGANIZATION AND I LOVE
WORKING WITH HER AND BEING ABLE TO HELP HER AND HER HELPING US
IN THE SUPPORT SO ORGANIZATION AND PEOPLE LIKE ANY IS THE
REASON WHY CAPTAINS I BELIEVE DO SO WELL AND LASTLY I HAVE TO
REALLY THANK THE OFFICERS AT CENTRAL STATION WHO DAY IN, DAY
OUT PUT THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE TO PROTECT THE CITIZENS OF
DISTRICT THREE. >> OBVIOUSLY BUT ALL THE
OFFICERS IN SAN FRANCISCO BUT I HAVE TO RECOGNIZE FINALLY THE
BACKBONE WHEN I WAS A CAPTAIN BACKBONE WAS MY STAFF WHO'S
BEHIND ME RIGHT NOW. I WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN
SUCCESSFUL AT ALL WITHOUT THEIR HARD WORK AND OBVIOUSLY I TELL
PEOPLE THEY'RE ACTUALLY THE BRAINS OF THE OPERATION. I'M JUST THE FACE BUT THEY ARE THE BRAINS AND WITHOUT THEM
THERE IS NO WAY THAT I WOULD HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL AT CENTRAL
STATION. >> SO I WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY
HERE AND THANK YOU AGAIN FOR ITS RECOGNITION. >> THEIR SUPERVISOR
SUPERVISOR CHERYL YOU READY FOR US?
>> DISTRICT TWO SUPERVISOR CHERYL ALL RIGHT. LUCAS AND MAX, PLEASE COME UP TO THE PODIUM.

I THOUGHT IT WAS VERY FITTING THAT I GOT SOME GOOD NEWS YESTERDAY IN MY HOME CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO.
THE CITY MEANS A LOT TO ME. I HAVE 415 ON MY GLOVE.
BORN AND RAISED HERE. IT'S JUST A SUPER UNIQUE EXPERIENCE. I THINK AS YOU AS YOU GO ALONG
IN THIS GAME YOU DON'T SEE A LOT OF PEOPLE WITH OUR
BACKGROUNDS GROWING UP IN A CITY LIKE THIS IS VERY UNIQUE
SPOT BUT I COULDN'T AGREE WITH YOU MORE.
I'D LIKE TO THANK MY MOM. SHE'S MY ROCK.
WITHOUT HER I WOULD NOT BE IN A POSITION TO DO WHAT I'VE DONE
DRIVING ME EVERYWHERE, BUY ME NEW EQUIPMENT.
SO YOU'RE SACRIFICING EVERYTHING SO LIKE TO PUT ME
IN THE RIGHT SPOT. SO I'D REALLY LIKE TO THANK HER. THANK COACH GERALD DEFINITELY
PLAYED OVER 1000 GAMES WITH THAT GUY GROWING UP. HE BUILT A FOUNDATION SO THANK YOU GUYS FOR HAVING ME
. >> DISTRICT FIVE SUPERVISOR MAHMOOD. GOOD AFTERNOON COLLEAGUES.
IT IS MY GREAT HONOR TO RECOGNIZE THE LEGENDARY ALICE
WONG ALICE FOR THOSE I DON'T KNOW IS A VISIONARY LEADER
CULTURAL ORGANIZER AND ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL VOICES IN THE
DISABILITY JUSTICE MOVEMENT. ALICE'S WORK HAS REDEFINED NOT
ONLY HOW WE UNDERSTAND DISABILITY BUT ALSO HOW WE
UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER. >> ALICE IS AN ACTIVIST, A
WRITER, EDITOR AND COMMUNITY BUILDER.
SHE IS THE FOUNDER AND THE DIRECTOR OF THE DISABILITY
VISIBILITY PROJECT, A PLATFORM DEDICATED TO CREATING
AND AMPLIFYING MEDIA AND CULTURE FOR AND BY DISABLED
PEOPLE. >> WHAT STARTED AS AN ORAL
HISTORY PROJECT HAS GROWN INTO A POWERFUL FORCE FOR CULTURAL
CHANGE. >> THROUGH HER WORK, ALICE HAS
OPEN SPACE FOR STORIES THAT HAVE LONG BEEN IGNORED OR KEPT
SILENT. >> STORIES OF JOY, RELATIONSHIPS AND JUSTICE AS STORIES OF OUR HUMANITY.
IT'S REFLECTIVE OF ALICE'S WORK WHICH IS DEEPLY ROOTED
IN COMMUNITY AND CARE. AS A LONGTIME SAN FRANCISCAN,
SHE IS A BELOVED FIGURE NOT ONLY IN OUR CITY BUT ACROSS THE
COUNTRY AND BEYOND. >> THROUGH HER MEMOIR YEAR OF
THE TIGER ANTHOLOGY IS DISABILITY VISIBILITY
AND DISABILITY INTIMACY AND HER DIGITAL ORGANIZING.
>> ALICE HAS REDEFINED THE CONVERSATION AROUND DISABILITY
AND POWER. >> LAST YEAR ALICE WAS AWARDED
THE PRESTIGIOUS MACARTHUR FELLOWSHIP OR GENIUS GRANT FOR
HER VISIONARY LEADERSHIP. SHE HAS ALSO LED NATIONAL
CAMPAIGNS LIKE CRIP THE VOTE, WHICH ENCOURAGED PLATFORMS TO
HIRE DISABLED WRITERS THROUGH DISABLED WRITERS.COM AND RAISE
FUNDS FOR THE ACCESS LOVE PROJECT WITH MAYA MINGUS
AND SANDI. >> HER LEADERSHIP IS EXPANSIVE
,INTERSECTIONAL BUT ALWAYS INCLUSIVE. ALICE'S ADVOCACY SPANS POP CULTURE, HEALTH CARE, POLITICS,
FOOD AND EDUCATION. AND THROUGH IT ALL SHE INVITES
US TO IMAGINE A WORLD WHERE ACCESS IS THE NORM NOT THE
EXCEPTION. >> ONE OF ALICE'S MOST POWERFUL
REFLECTIONS IS THIS STORYTELLING IS A POWERFUL FORM
OF RESISTANCE. >> IT LEAVES EVIDENCE THAT WE
WERE HERE IN A TIME WHEN DISABLED PEOPLE ARE OFTEN MADE
TO FEEL ISOLATED. ALICE'S WORK INSISTS ON
WHOLENESS AND EMPOWERMENT, BUT SHE DOESN'T JUST TELL HER OWN
STORY. >> SHE CREATES SPACE FOR OTHERS
TO SHARE THEIRS. SHE BUILDS COALITIONS
AND COMMUNITIES. >> SHE MENTORS RISING LEADERS
AND SHE CREATES THE SPACE WHICH RESHAPES THE WORLD AND PROCESS
. >> IT'S ALSO WORTH NOTING THAT ALICE IS A HUGE STAR WARS FAN WHICH I ALSO PERSONALLY CAN
ATTEST TO HAVING GROWN UP WITH. AND I SAY THIS IN THAT SHE IS
NOT JUST A JEDI KNIGHT BUT ANOINTING HER AS A JEDI MASTER
JUST FEELS RIGHT. >> SHE BRINGS THAT CLARITY
AND CONVICTION AND COMPASSION TO EVERY SPACE SHE ENTERS.
AND LIKE A TRUE JEDI CHANNELS THE FORCE OF THE COMMUNITY TO
DISRUPT INJUSTICE AND FORM A PATH TOWARDS A BETTER WORLD.
>> ALICE YOUR VOICE HAS TRANSFORMED HOW WE THINK, HOW
WE WRITE AND HOW WE ORGANIZE. AND AS WE PREPARE TO RECOGNIZE
THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITY ACT,
WE CELEBRATE YOUR WORK TO SHIFT OUR CULTURE FROM ONE OF
EXCLUSION AND TO ONE OF INTERDEPENDENCE. >> YOU'VE TAUGHT US THAT ACCESS IS LOVE AND SETTING AN EXAMPLE
THAT TRUE INCLUSION REQUIRES IMAGINATION, HUMILITY AND A BIT
OF ARTISTRY. >> AND LASTLY TO CLOSE I'D LIKE
TO QUOTE FROM ONE JEDI MASTER TO ANOTHER FROM A FAMOUS PERSON
NAMED YODA. AND I'M NOT GOING TO IMITATE
SIZE MATTERS NOT. LOOK AT ME.
JUDGE ME BY MY SIZE. DO YOU?
HMM HMM. >> I GUESS HE HUMS A LOT WHILE
YOU SHOULD NOT. FOR MY ALLIES, THE FORCE AND A POWERFUL ALLY IT IS. LIFE CREATES IT MAKES IT GROW.
ITS ENERGY SURROUNDS US AND BINDS US. LUMINOUS BEINGS ARE WE NOT THE CRUDE MATTER OF OUR BODY?
>> YOU MUST FEEL THE FORCE AROUND YOU HERE BETWEEN YOU,
ME, THE TREE, THE ROCK EVERYWHERE.
>> SO ALICE, MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU.
>> HOW? THIS IS QUITE AN HONOR.
I'D LIKE TO THANK THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS.
PLEASE LOOK AT ME WHEN I AM TALKING TO YOU.
THANK. HAVE SOME IMPORTANT STUFF TO SAY AND ESPECIALLY A SHOUT OUT TO SUPERVISOR MAHMOOD AND HIS
STAFF. AND BY THE WAY, CONGRATULATE
SUPERVISOR MAHMOOD ON IDENTIFYING AS AN AUTISTIC
PERSON PUBLICLY. WELCOME TO OUR AMAZING DIVERSE
COMMUNITY. AND IF YOU EVER WANT TO HANG OUT AND TALK ABOUT DISABILITY JUSTICE, I'M YOUR DISABLED
CYBORG. I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU AGAIN
FROM THE OFFICE ON DISABILITY AND ACCESSIBILITY FOR HIS
FRIENDSHIP AND SUPPORT. AND BY THE WAY, I THINK HE'S
DOING A STELLAR JOB IN THE FEW MONTHS ELI HAS BEEN IN THIS
POSITION. THE CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN
FRANCISCO IS LUCKY TO HAVE HIM. I WANT TO THANK MY FRIENDS
AND FAMILY WHO HAVE ALWAYS HAD MY BACK.
I WANT TO THANK MY DISABLED COMRADES SUCH AS DEBBIE KAPLAN
AND SACHA BITTNER WHO ARE ALSO RECOGNIZED TODAY.
AND I WANT TO HONOR MY FRIEND PATTI BYRNE WHO TRANSITION TO
THE GREAT BEYOND ONLY A FEW MONTHS AGO PATTI WAS THE
EXECUTIVE AND ARTISTIC DIRECTOR OF THE PERFORMANCE ARTS GROUP
SINCE INVALID AND ONE OF THE FOUNDERS OF THE DISABILITY
JUSTICE FRAMEWORK. WITHOUT HER WISDOM WE WOULD NOT
HAVE DISABILITY JUSTICE AS WE KNOW IT TODAY.
I MOVED HERE OVER 25 YEARS AGO TO ATTEND GRADUATE SCHOOL
AND YOU SEE US AS MOVED HERE IS BECAUSE OF THE ACCESSIBILITY
AND AGGRESSIVENESS OF THIS CITY AND STATE.
THANKS TO PROGRAMS SUCH AS H. S S AND A MEDI-CAL WAIVER I
HAVE BEEN ABLE TO LIVE AND WORK IN THE COMMUNITY WHICH IS NOT
THE CASE FOR SO MANY DISABLED PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY WITH
COMPLEX MEDICAL NEEDS LIKE MINE.
I HAVE THE PRIVILEGE TO LEARN ABOUT DISABILITY JUSTICE FROM
SOME OF THE KEY THINKERS AND DEVELOPERS LIKE THE LATE
PATTI BYRNE, THE LATE STACEY PARKE MILBURN AND MIA MINGUS.
AS I REFLECT ON THIS IDEA ANNIVERSARY MONTH I FEEL
AMBIVALENT ABOUT ITS CELEBRATORY NATURE.
I STRUGGLE TO FEEL FESTIVE AND PROUD WHEN THERE ARE SO
MANY THREATS FACING DISABLED PEOPLE LOCALLY AND NATIONALLY.
TO THE SUPERVISORS AND OTHER ELECTED OFFICIALS IN THIS ROOM
I WANT TO SAY THAT THIS CITY DESPERATELY NEEDS TO UNDERSTAND
WHAT DISABILITY JUSTICE IS AND IMPLEMENT ITS PRINCIPLES
INTO THE POLICIES AND PRACTICES THAT IMPACT EVERYONE.
ONE PRINCIPLE OF DISABILITY JUSTICE IS COLLECTIVE
LIBERATION. THE BELIEF THAT WE LEAVE NO ONE
BEHIND AND WE ARE DOING JUST THAT IN THIS CITY.
I AM ENRAGED BY THE PASSAGE OF THE H.R. ONE ALSO KNOWN AS THE
BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL AND THE UPCOMING CUTS TO MEDICAID FOOD
STAMPS AND OTHER SAFETY NET PROGRAMS.
WE ARE ON A CLEAR PATH TOWARD AUTOCRACY LED BY A FASCIST
WHITE NATIONALIST AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL AND THIS IS NOT HELPED BY OUR OWN GOVERNOR WHO RESTORED THE ASSET LIMITS
IN MEDI-CAL. AFTER YEARS OF ADVOCACY BY THE
DISABILITY COMMUNITY AND THE DENIAL OF MEDI-CAL TO
UNDOCUMENTED APPLICANTS, I WILL TAKE EFFECT IN THE NEAR FUTURE.
I FEAR THAT HOME AND COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES WILL BE FIRST ON
THE CHOPPING BLOCK BECAUSE THEY ARE CONSIDERED OPTIONAL MEDICAID SERVICES AND LIKE NURSING HOMES.
THIS IS NOT DISABILITY JUSTICE. RIGHT NOW DISABLED IMMIGRANTS
ARE BEING KIDNAPED BY ICE WITHOUT DUE PROCESS AND DENIED
ACCESS TO THEIR MEDICATIONS. THERE ARE FAMILIES RIPPED APART
AND ENTIRE FAMILIES DEPORTED INCLUDING CHILDREN WITH CANCER.
IMMIGRANTS WHO ARE FOLLOWING THE LAW ARE GETTING SNATCHED UP
JUST A FEW BLOCKS FROM HERE AT 1 A.M. ON ST ASAPH PD DOES
NOTHING TO INTERVENE WHETHER THEY ARE LEGALLY ALLOWED TO OR NOT. WHAT IS HAPPENING IN LOS
ANGELES WILL HAPPEN TO OUR CITY FAIRLY SOON AND I URGE ANYONE
WITH POWER IN THIS ROOM AND CITY HALL TO RESIST WITH
ALL OF THE POWERS THEY HAVE AND PREVENT THIS FROM
TERRORIZING COMMUNITIES OF COLOR WHO BY THE WINK LEAD
MONOLINGUAL UNDOCUMENTED DISABLED PEOPLE.
ICE IS THE ENTITY CREATING MAJOR THREATS TO PUBLIC SAFETY
. ICE IS LAYING SIEGE AND CAUSING VIOLENCE NOT PEACEFUL PROTESTERS WHO ARE BEARING
WITNESS TO RACIST XENOPHOBIC INJUSTICE.
THIS IS NOT DISABILITY JUSTICE. I LIVE IN THE SOUTH OF
AMERICA'S NEIGHBORHOOD DISTRICT SIX AND IT HAS BEEN
DISHEARTENING TO SEE UNHOUSED PEOPLE DISPLACED IN THE NAME OF
INTERNALIZATION. A SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE OF
UNHOUSED PEOPLE IN SAN FRANCISCO HAVE DISABILITIES
SUCH AS SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER AND SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS.
THE SOLUTION BY THIS MAYOR'S ADMINISTRATION AND THE GOVERNOR
IS TO INSTITUTIONALIZE THEM AND FORCE TREATMENT REGRESSING
DECADES OF ADVOCACY BY DISABLED PEOPLE FOR THE RIGHT TO LIVE
IN THE COMMUNITY AUTONOMOUSLY. THANKS TO THE SUPREME COURT
DECISION AND GRANTS PASSED FOR JOHNSON WHICH RULED THAT LOCAL
GOVERNMENT ORDINANCE IS WITH CIVIL AND CRIMINAL PENALTIES
FOR CAMPING ON PUBLIC LAND DO NOT CONSTITUTE CRUEL
AND UNUSUAL PUNISHMENT OF HOMELESS PEOPLE.
IT ESSENTIALLY GIVES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FREE REIN TO
DISPLACE UNHOUSED PEOPLE WITH LITTLE RECOURSE WHICH IS CRUEL
AND UNUSUAL. WE DO NOT NEED MORE HOSPITAL
BEDS. WE NEED ACCESSIBLE AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING WITH SUPPORTIVE SERVICES FROM
NONPROFITS. BUT THAT'S NOT LIKELY WHAT THE
SLASHING OF BUDGETS THAT ELIMINATE THESE CRITICAL SERVICES THAT ACTUALLY SAVES MONEY BY PREVENTING
HOSPITALIZATIONS AND EMERGENCY ROOM VISITS.
AND THE REASON WHY SO MANY PEOPLE ARE ON THE STREETS AS A
FUNCTION OF THE ECONOMY AND A LACK OF HOUSING STOCK FOR SOME
REASON IT'S EASIER FOR THIS MAYOR TO INVEST
IN INSTITUTIONAL AND CARCERAL SETTINGS RATHER THAN INVESTING
IN COMMUNITY BASED SOLUTIONS. SOMEONE CAME TO VISIT ME LATELY
AND WAS SO SCARED TO PARK IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD HONESTLY MENTIONING HOW SHE SAW WHITE HOBOS ON THE STREET.
THIS CASUAL COMMENT INCENSED ME BECAUSE IT'S SO EASY TO
DEHUMANIZE POOR DISABLED PEOPLE UNDOCUMENTED PEOPLE
AND UNHOUSED PEOPLE IN ORDER TO FACILITATE POLICIES THAT
ENCOURAGE HARASSED THEM IN THE NAME OF SAFETY.
THE MINDSET IS OUT OF SIGHT, OUT OF MIND AS EUGENICS.
THIS IS NOT DISABILITY JUSTICE .
IF YOU LISTEN TO THE WISDOM OF DISABLED PEOPLE, DISABLED
PEOPLE OF COLOR IN PARTICULAR YOU WOULD KNOW THAT WE KEEP
EACH OTHER SAFE NOT THE POLICE OR OTHER AGENCIES SUCH AS ICE.
WITH MY WORK AS THE CREATOR OF THE DISABILITY VISIBILITY
PROJECT I BELIEVE DISABILITY IS PART OF RESISTANCE AGAINST ALL
THE FORCES THAT WANT TO ERASE US.
I TRY MY BEST TO SHOW THE NUANCES, THE MESSINESS, THE
REAL MISS, THE BEAUTY OF DISABLED PEOPLE IN A WORLD THAT
THINKS WE ARE ALL TAKERS WHO GET SPECIAL TREATMENT WHEN
THERE ACTUALLY RIDES AND ACCOMMODATIONS UNDER THE
LAW. OUR NARRATIVES MATTER AND OUR
CARING POWER AND WISDOM CAN BE OF VALUE TO EVERYONE IF ONLY
PEOPLE LISTEN AND BELIEVE US. TO THE SUPERVISOR IN THIS ROOM
YOU SHOULD KNOW HOW BLESSED WE ARE TO BE IN THE BEAR.
HEAR THE SIDE OF THE INDEPENDENT LIVING MOVEMENT AND DECADES OF DISABILITY HISTORY AND CULTURE.
JUST A FEW BLOCKS FROM HERE WAS THE SITE OF THE 504 SIT INS THE
LONGEST OCCUPATION OF A FEDERAL BUILDING IN THE FIGHT FOR
DISABILITY RIGHTS IN THE 1970S SEVEN RESISTING THE FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT IS NOTHING NEW. WE SHOULD LEARN FROM THE PAST
AND HARNESS PEOPLE POWER TODAY. RIGHT NOW WE NEED COMMUNITY
MORE THAN EVER. IT WAS A LIFELINE THAT SAVED ME
DECADES AGO WHEN I WAS STARVED FOR CONNECTION THE RIGHTS
ENSHRINED BY THE IDEA THAT MADE US SO PROTECTED CLASS IS
SOMETHING THAT MUST BE DEFENDED IN THIS ANTI-INTELLECTUAL
CULTURE THAT IS DISMANTLING DEMOCRACY.
DIVERSITY EQUITY INCLUSION RIGHT BEFORE OUR EYES.
I URGE EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM TO NOT LOOK AWAY TO DEMAND
ACCOUNTABILITY FROM OUR ELECTED OFFICIALS AND TO STAND UP FOR
OUR COMMUNITIES. THANK YOU.
>> DISTRICT SEVEN SUPERVISOR MELGAR.

ACCESSIBLE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION WITH ADOPT.
SHE RECEIVED A DEGREE IN SOCIAL WORK WELFARE FROM UC BERKELEY
BUT BEFORE THAT SHE ATTENDED LOWELL HIGH SCHOOL AND SUED THE
SAN FRANCISCO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT FOR EXCLUDING STUDENTS

SHE CONTINUES TO ADVOCATE FOR HER COMMUNITY IN THE COMMUNITY

THEIR UNIQUE EXPERIENCES ARE DEEPLY INTERTWINED WITH THE
VICTORIES THAT THEY HAVE SHARED. >> THANK YOU, SASHA, FOR YOUR COMMITTED AND TIRELESS

SUPPORTING AN AMAZING PERSON LIKE SASHA AND I THANK YOU FOR
ALL THE COMMUNITY MEMBERS WHO HAVE COME OUT TODAY TO SUPPORT
YOU, SASHA. FOR PRESERVING AND ADVANCING JUSTICE IN OUR CITY, OUR STATE AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY.
>> THANK YOU AND THANK YOU. NO GO AND WERE IN THE BOOTH
AND WITH THEM. >> THANK YOU SUPERVISOR MELDER
FOR THAT WONDERFUL INTRODUCTION YOU GAVE ME.
I WOULD GIVE YOU ALL THEY'VE BEEN GIVING TO ME AND I'M
SASHA'S BROTHER CALEB AND I'LL BE HELPING VOICE A FEW WORDS ON
TODAY AS I REFLECT ON HOW FAR WE HAVE COME AND MAKING AMERICA
MORE INCLUSIVE FOR DISABLED PEOPLE, I ALSO WATCH IN HORROR AS THE PROGRAMS THAT HAVE HELPED US ACHIEVE THESE GOALS
ARE DECIMATED. WHEN I WAS BORN IN 1973 TO A
SINGLE TEENAGE MOTHER, MANY DISABLED CHILDREN WERE STILL
PLACED IN INSTITUTIONS WITH EXPECTATIONS FOR US VERY LOW.
A RENOWNED PEDIATRICIAN TOLD HER I'D NEVER BE ABLE TO DO
MUCH OF ANYTHING. THANKFULLY MY MOTHER HAD A
DIFFERENT OPINION BUT FACED YEARS OF STRUGGLE TO GET ME THE SUPPORT AND SERVICES I NEEDED. IN 1980 WE MOVED TO SAN
FRANCISCO SPECIFICALLY LAKEWOOD AVENUE AND SUPERVISOR MELGEN'S
DISTRICT WHERE MY MOM AND DAD FIRST MET.
AT THAT TIME THERE WAS NO RAMP PLATFORMS FOR STREETCARS SO MY
MOTHER HAD TO CARRY ME ON THE CARRIER. THERE WAS ALSO NO CURB CUTS OR BUSSES AND EVEN THE FEW SCHOOLS
AVAILABLE TO ME AS A SPECIALIZED STUDENT HAD LIMITED
ACCESSIBILITY. WHAT WE DIDN'T INITIALLY
REALIZE THOUGH WAS THAT THE BAY AREA, ESPECIALLY BERKELEY HAD
ALSO BECOME THE CENTER OF A GROWING DISABILITY RIGHTS MOVEMENT. AS MY MOTHER LEARNED ABOUT THIS
MOVEMENT SHE BEGAN TO SEE DISABILITY MORE AS A CIVIL
RIGHTS PROBLEM THAN A MEDICAL ONE WITH SOLUTIONS THAT INVOLVES CHANGING ATTITUDES AND LAWS WHILE CREATING
ACCESSIBLE, ACCOMMODATING AND INCLUSIVE COMMUNITIES.
WHEN I WAS BULLIED IN EIGHTH GRADE BECAUSE OF MY DISABILITY
,MY MOTHER WANTED NOT ONLY TO COMFORT AND SUPPORT ME BUT TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM MORE WIDELY.
WE JOINED A NONPROFIT STARTED AT THE CENTER FOR INDEPENDENT
LIVING IN BERKELEY TO ENSURE MORE INCLUSIVE AND WELCOMING SCHOOLS. KIDS PROJECT BROUGHT DISABLED
GUEST SPEAKERS INTO CLASSROOMS TO TALK ABOUT THEIR LIVES THE
DISABILITY RIGHTS MOVEMENT BARRIERS ACCESSIBILITY,
INDEPENDENT LIVING DISCRIMINATION AND OTHER ISSUES IN ORDER TO PROVIDE INFORMATION, DISPEL
STEREOTYPES, RECOGNIZE SIMILARITIES AND ALSO CELEBRATE
OUR DIFFERENCES. I BECAME INVOLVED IN THE
DISABILITY RIGHTS MOVEMENT AND HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF LEARNING FROM SUCH TRAILBLAZERS AS ED ROBERTS JUDY HUMAN AND OF
COURSE MY FELLOW PERFORMERS IN WRITE TRIPS DISABLED WOMEN'S
THEATER GROUP. WHILE DEVELOPING A SENSE OF PRIDE IN MY COMMUNITY AND CULTURE.
EVENTUALLY MOM BECAME THE DIRECTOR OF KIDS PROJECT AND I
BECAME A PROGRAM MANAGER AS PART OF A COLLABORATIVE FUNDED
BY DCF. FOR 20 YEARS WE EDUCATED THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS IN SAN FRANCISCO SCHOOLS ABOUT THE
VALUE OF YES DIVERSITY, EQUITY AND INCLUSION.
SO CURRENT ATTEMPTS TO GUT MY EFFORTS ARE AN ATTACK ON MY
LIFE'S WORK. WHEN WE WERE TOLD THIS CARNAGE
WILL HELP MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. TO WHAT GREAT ERA IN AMERICA DO THEY REFER?
WAS IT WHEN MY PEOPLE WERE WAREHOUSED IN INSTITUTIONS
AND COMPLETELY EXCLUDED FROM CIVIC LIFE? WAS IT WHEN PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION, RESTAURANTS,
MOVIES AND SCHOOLS WERE INACCESSIBLE AND UNCOMMON
DATING AND WE WERE STIGMATIZED, DISCRIMINATED AGAINST AND TREATED WITH CONTEMPT? WHEN MY MOTHER STRUGGLED TO GET
ME INCLUDED IN REGULAR EDUCATION OR WHEN WE HAD TO
FIGHT TO GET AN ENTRANCE RAMP TO MY HIGH SCHOOL DOOR
AND ACCESS TO EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES. >> THE PROMISE OF AMERICA FOR MY PEOPLE HAS ONLY JUST BEGUN
TO BE REALIZED. AND NOW THEY WANT TO RETURN TO
WHAT FOR US WAS THE DARK AGES. FOR THE LAST 15 YEARS I
PARTICULARLY FOCUSED ON EXPANSION OF HOME AND COMMUNITY
BASED SERVICES CRITICAL COMPONENTS OF
SELF-DETERMINATION AND INCLUSION THAT ALLOW DISABLED PEOPLE AND SENIORS TO LIVE IN OUR HOMES
AND COMMUNITIES INSTEAD OF INSTITUTIONS OR NURSING HOMES.
UNFORTUNATELY THESE PROGRAMS ARE DEPENDENT ON MEDICAID FUNDING AND WE'VE ALL JUST LEARNED HOW MUCH THE PRO-LIFE
PARTY CARES ABOUT MY LIFE. >> WITH AN AGING WORKFORCE
INCREASING HOMECARE NEEDS FROM THE BABY BOOMER COHORT AND A
SCARCITY OF YOUNGER PEOPLE IN THE WORKFORCE, WE ALREADY
HAVE A DIRE SHORTAGE OF HOMECARE WORKERS WHO PROVIDE THESE ESSENTIAL SERVICES. SLASHING MEDICAID WHILE
MANDATING MASS DEPORTATIONS WILL MASSIVELY EXACERBATE THAT
SITUATION AGAIN. FOR WHOM IS THIS MAKING AMERICA GREAT? >> WHEN SPEAKER EMERITA NANCY
PELOSI APPOINTED ME TO THE NATIONAL COUNCIL ON DISABILITY
IN 2022, I LEARNED IT WAS THIS COUNCIL THAT FIRST PROPOSED THE
ADA AND HELPED GET IT ENACTED. WHILE WE STILL HAVE A LONG WAY
TO GO. WHEN I TRAVELED TO NEW YORK FOR A COUNCIL MEETING IN MAY, I EXPERIENCED FIRSTHAND THE
ENORMOUS PROGRESS AND ACCESSIBILITY SINCE I FIRST
VISITED THE CITY BEFORE THE ADA PASSAGE. BUT THE HIGHLIGHT OF THE TRIP HAPPENED AFTER WE ATTENDED A
PERFORMANCE OF WICKED. WE'RE ABLE TO HAVE A TALK BACK
WITH THE FIRST DISABLED ACTRESS TO PLAY THE ROLE OF DISABLED CHARACTER NESSA ON BROADWAY. HEARING HER STORY AND SEEING
THAT GLASS CEILING SHATTERED CEILING SHATTERED WAS BEYOND
UPLIFTING AND INSPIRING. I WANT EVERYONE TO KNOW NO
MATTER WHAT DESTRUCTION THIS ADMINISTRATION WREAKS, WE'RE
NOT GOING BACK. IN CLOSING, I'D LIKE TO
ACKNOWLEDGE THE CRITICAL WORK BEING DONE BY MY COLLEAGUES
IN THE DISABILITY AND DOMESTIC WORKERS RIGHTS MOVEMENT. AND TO THANK OF ALL OF THOSE WHO'VE SUPPORTED AND UPLIFTED
ME THROUGHOUT MY LIFE INCLUDING TEACHERS, POLITICAL OFFICIALS,
COMMUNITY ACTIVISTS AND LEADERS LIKE THE RECENTLY DEPARTED JOE
FELDMAN WHO WAS SO INSTRUMENTAL IN SECURING THE EDUCATIONAL
SERVICES THAT HELPED ME THRIVE .
MY COLLEAGUES, NEIGHBORS AND DEAR FRIENDS PEOPLE
CHRISTINE PELOSI FIRST REFERRED TO AS TEAM SASHA.
FINALLY, I'D LIKE TO EXPRESS MY DEEP APPRECIATION TO MY LOVING
FAMILY THE MOST IMPORTANT OF TEAM SASHA INCLUDING MY SISTER
ANIKA WHO IS WATCHING FROM L.A. AND ESPECIALLY TO MY MOM EMILY
MATTERS BITTNER, WHO'S BEEN WITH ME FROM THE START.
WE DEFINITELY PROVED THAT PEDIATRICIAN AND SO MANY OTHERS
WRONG WHO PROPOSED THE MALCOLM VERDICT?
>> INCREDIBLE. NO. THANK YOU. SUPERVISOR MELGAR FOR THIS
INCREDIBLE HONOR AND BEING SO DEEP WITHIN FOOD THREE ADA.
>> HAPPY 30TH ANNIVERSARY TO THE ADA AND TO ALL OF YOU.
KEEP YOUR EYES IN THE PRIZE. >> ALL RIGHT.
AND TO ALL OF YOU, KEEP YOUR EYES ON THE PRIZE.
WE WILL NOT BE MOVED. WE WILL NOT BE MOVED
. >> CONGRATULATION ON SASHA
BITTNER. AND THAT BRINGS US TO OUR FINAL
COMMENDATION OF THE DAY FROM DISTRICT EIGHT DEBORAH KAPLAN.
>> COLLEAGUES TODAY I AM PRESENTING A SPECIAL
ACCOMMODATION TO DEBBIE KAPLAN A PIONEERING DISABILITY RIGHTS
ATTORNEY AND ACTIVIST WHO CURRENTLY SERVES AS THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE SAN FRANCISCO OFFICE ON DISABILITY
AND ACCESSIBILITY. >> DEBBIE WAS BORN
IN CLEVELAND, OHIO WHILE SHE WAS GROWING UP. HER FAMILY MOVED TO MASSACHUSETTS AND EVENTUALLY TO
COLORADO. SHE MOVED TO CALIFORNIA IN 1967
TO ATTEND UC SANTA CRUZ, WHERE SHE MAJORED IN RELIGIOUS
STUDIES AND FROM WHICH SHE GRADUATED IN 1971. SHE WORKED AS A SUBSTITUTE TEACHER, HOUSECLEANER
AND WAITRESS BEFORE DECIDING TO GO TO LAW SCHOOL.
>> IN MAY 1972 ON A BACKPACKING TRIP WITH HER FRIENDS IN THE
SANTA CRUZ MOUNTAINS, DEBBIE BROKE HER NECK DIVING INTO A CREEK AND WAS LEFT QUADRIPLEGIC.
>> SHE SPENT NINE MONTHS IN REHAB BUT EMERGED UNDETERRED
FROM HER QUEST TO BE A LAWYER. SHE APPLIED TO UC BERKELEY LAW
SCHOOL UNIQUE AT THE TIME FOR HAVING A PROGRAM FOR DISABLED
STUDENTS. IN 1974, DEBBIE CO-FOUNDED THE
DISABLED WOMEN'S COALITION AT UC BERKELEY.
THE SAME YEAR SHE CO-FOUNDED THE DISABILITY RIGHTS CENTER
FROM 1980 TO 1985, SHE WAS AN ATTORNEY FOR THE DISABILITY
RIGHTS EDUCATION AND DEFENSE FUND, A NATIONAL DISABILITY
CIVIL RIGHTS LAW AND POLICY CENTER DIRECTED BY INDIVIDUALS AND PARENTS WHO HAVE CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES.
>> IN 19 97 SHE BECAME THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE WORLD
INSTITUTE ON DISABILITY WHERE SHE PIONEERED PROJECTS ON
POLICY AND FOCUSED ON UNIVERSAL DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY.
SHE ALSO HEADED THE ACCESSIBLE TECHNOLOGY INITIATIVE FOR THE
CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM AND LATER SERVED ON THE
AS THE SECTION FIVE A POLICY LEAD AN AGENCY WIDE SECTION
FIVE AWAY COORDINATOR IN THE OFFICE OF THE CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICER AT THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES.
DEBBIE JOINED THE MAYOR'S OFFICE ON DISABILITY NOW THE
OFFICE ON DISABILITY AND ACCESSIBILITY.
IN APRIL OF 2020 AS DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF PROGRAMMATIC ACCESS
SHE OVERSEES ALL ASPECTS OF PROGRAMMATIC ACCESSIBILITY COMPLIANCE AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE ON BEHALF OF ODA
WHICH INCLUDES FIELDING ACCESSIBLE 80 COMPLAINTS
AND CONCERNS ENSURING EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION AND DIGITAL ACCESS AND HELPING TO CREATE CITYWIDE TRAINING ON
ACCESSIBILITY BEST PRACTICES. SHE ALSO LEADS THE OFFICE'S
ENGAGEMENT EFFORTS PERTAINING TO VISION ZERO AND ALL LOCAL
LEGISLATION IMPACTING PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND ADVISES
THE MAYOR'S DISABILITY COUNCIL. >> I GOT TO KNOW DEBBIE WHILE
WORKING ON OUR BEYOND THE FRONT DOOR LEGISLATION.
WHILE SHE WAS ACTING DIRECTOR OF THE THEN MAYOR'S OFFICE ON DISABILITY, I FOUND HER TO BE A TERRIFIC PARTNER IN THAT EFFORT
AND I'M GRATEFUL FOR HER WISE COUNSEL PRAGMATISM AND DEEP
KNOWLEDGE OF THE ISSUES BASED ON HER DECADES OF WORK AND HER
LIVED EXPERIENCE. DEBBIE I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR
YOUR SERVICE TO SAN FRANCISCO AND YOUR ADVOCACY ON BEHALF OF ALL PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. AND NOW THE FLOOR IS YOURS.
PROBABLY, YEAH. THANKS A LOT.
I THINK I GOT IT. >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
I'LL JUST TURN AROUND A BIT. >> SO THANK YOU PRESIDENT
MALDONADO AND MEMBERS OF THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS.
I HAVE BEEN REFLECTING SINCE THIS IS THE MONTH OF THE 35TH
ANNIVERSARY OF THE ADA HOW LONG IT'S BEEN THAT I'VE BEEN
INVOLVED IN THE DISABILITY RIGHTS MOVEMENT AND IT'S OVER
50 YEARS WHICH COMES AS A BIT OF A SHOCK TO EVEN BE ABLE TO
SAY THAT AT THIS POINT IN LIFE. AND I HAVE TO SHARE THAT I FEEL
EXTREMELY LUCKY TO HAVE HAD THAT ACCIDENT WHEN AND WHERE
THAT I DID BECAUSE IT HAPPENED REALLY NEAR THE BAY AREA
IN BERKELEY AND I THEN HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF BEING INVOLVED
LOVED AT THE BEGINNING OF THE DISABILITY RIGHTS MOVEMENT IN BERKELEY AND WORKING WITH MANY, MANY OTHER FOLKS WITH
DISABILITY LIZ WHO TOOK THE RADICAL AND EMPOWERMENT IDEAS
OF OTHER HUMAN RIGHTS AND DISABILITY AND CIVIL RIGHTS
MOVEMENTS AND APPLIED THEM TO OURSELVES AND HAVE HAD THE
PRIVILEGE OF CHANGING THE WORLD .
YOU'VE HEARD A LOT TODAY ABOUT OTHER PIONEERS IN OUR MOVEMENT
AND THE SITUATION THAT PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES CURRENTLY
FIND OURSELVES IN. AND YET WHAT WE ALSO KNOW IS
THAT THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES ARE NOT
OBVIOUS TO OTHERS. MOST DISABILITIES ARE NOT
VISIBLE AND YET THE LAWS THAT WE HAVE PUT INTO PLACE
AND BENEFITED FROM FOR DECADES NOW HAVE BENEFITED FAR MORE
THAN YOU MIGHT THINK. AND THOSE OF US WHO DO HAVE
HIDDEN DISABILITIES KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.
>> IF WE LOOK AT HOW THE ADA HAS CHANGED EVERYBODY'S LIVES,
I THINK WE THINK ABOUT CURB RAMPS AND THE FACT THAT
EVERYBODY USES CURB RAMPS. WHEN I TALK TO PEOPLE ON THE
STREET AND MENTION THAT THE CURB RAMPS WERE PUT IN PLACE
BECAUSE OF ACTIVISM BY FOLKS LIKE ME, THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE EVERYBODY USES THEM WHETHER
IT'S DELIVERY PEOPLE, PARENTS WITH STROLLERS OR JUST ALL
PEDESTRIANS JUST USED TO CURB RAMPS.
>> SOMETIMES I WANT THEM TO GET OUT OF THE WAY SO THAT I CAN.
AND THEN THE OTHER BIG CHANGE THAT'S MOST PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT
IS CAPTIONING ON TV PROGRAMING. >> THAT IS PART OF THE ADA
AND IS NOW A UBIQUITOUS PART OF STREAMING MEDIA AND THE VIDEOS
THAT ARE PART OF EVERYONE'S LIVES.
HOW MANY PEOPLE RELY ON CAPTIONS WHO ARE NOT DEAF OR
HARD OF HEARING AND ARE ABLE TO FULLY FOLLOW WHAT'S GOING ON
AND KNOW HAVE A BETTER EXPERIENCE OF THE VIDEO BECAUSE
OF THE ADA. AND I INVITE YOU AS
POLICYMAKERS TO UNDERSTAND THAT THOSE THINGS DON'T HAPPEN BY
ACCIDENT. IT'S BECAUSE WHEN WE DO THINGS
THINKING PRIMARILY OF PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES WE MAKE LIFE
BETTER IN WAYS THAT WE CAN'T FULLY PREDICT AND YET THAT IS
WHAT WILL COME ABOUT. IT'S NOT JUST DOING THINGS FOR
HANDICAPPED PEOPLE AND OLD FASHIONED IDEAS.
IT'S DOING THINGS FOR EVERYBODY.
AND I INVITE YOU AS YOU HOPEFULLY WILL HAVE THE CHANCE
TO REBUILD THINGS FROM THE WRECKAGE THAT IS CURRENTLY
GOING ON. >> HOPEFULLY WE WILL ALL HAVE A
CHANCE TO DO SOME OF THAT REBUILDING AND FINDING
OPPORTUNITIES TO MAKE THINGS BETTER WHEN WE DO RECONSTRUCT
OUR COUNTRY AND OUR STATE AND OUR CITY.
THAT THINK ABOUT WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS FROM TALKING WITH
PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AT THE VERY BEGINNING ABOUT WHAT OUR
NEEDS ARE NOT JUST TO DO THE RIGHT THING BUT TO MAKE THE
RIGHT POLICY AND MAKE THINGS BETTER IN UNPREDICTABLE WAYS
THAT EVERYONE WILL BENEFIT FROM. I HOPE THAT YOU TAKE THAT AWAY AS WE GET THROUGH THE NEXT FEW
YEARS AND I PRAY THAT WE WILL ALL BE ENGAGED
IN RECONSTRUCTION AND REALLY SOON.
. ALL RIGHT. I THINK WE'RE TRYING TO DO A PHOTO.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU.
ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. AND THAT'S FRIENDS IS OUR 230
SPECIAL COMMENDATIONS. >> AND WE WILL NOW GO BACK TO
OUR JUST AS. I THINK WE MIGHT BE DONE WITH SOME OF OUR DISCUSSION OF THE BUDGET BUT I THINK WE HAVE SOME
VOTES. SO MADAM CLERK YOU HAVE CALLED
ITEMS SEVEN THROUGH 38 BUT NOT INCLUDING 36.
WE HAVE TAKEN OUT OF THAT ITEM 715 AND 16 2021 AND 31.
>> SO COULD YOU CALL THE ROLL? >> WE HAVE A SPEAKER ON THE.
WE HAVE SOUP CHURCH IN. >> THANK YOU.
IF I MAY, COLLEAGUES, I WANT TO SAY IT IS NOT IF I MAY SAY ONE
OF THE REASON WHY IT IS CALLED TOGETHER AND OFTENTIME AS
BUDGET AND TRAILING LEGISLATION .
THERE'S NOTHING IN THE RULES AGAINST US TO CALL OUT
AND SEVER ALL THE ITEMS AND THEN VOTE ON THEM SEPARATELY. SO I JUST WANTED TO SAY THIS IS
THIS IS NOT THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.
WHAT I AM TALKING ABOUT THOUGH THAT IS TO BE CLEAR BEFORE YOU
CAST YOUR VOTES TODAY AS YOU CAST BOTH SEPARATE AND APART
AND THEN ALSO TO UNDERSTAND ALL OF THEM TOGETHER IS THAT IS
WHAT IS BEFORE YOU IS REALLY THE BUDGET.
WHAT IT MEANS THAT THE TRAILING LEGISLATION BE IT A PAY PARKING
FEES OR A COURT FEES. ALL THOSE ARE ACTUALLY HAVE
PHYSICAL IMPACT WITHOUT PASSING OF THESE TRAILING LEGISLATION.
IT ACTUALLY IMPACT THE ENTIRE BUDGET BECAUSE IT IS REVENUE
THAT WE ASSUME THAT WE WILL GENERATE AND WHAT WE CALL A
BUDGET THAT WE PUT TOGETHER BEFORE YOU TODAY.
SO BEFORE YOU CAST YOUR VOTE, I JUST WANTED TO AGAIN URGE FOR
YOUR SUPPORT FOR THESE ALL EACH AND EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM.
THEY ARE NOT WHAT WE LOVE. THEY ARE NOT GOOD OPTIONS.
NO ONE WANTS TO INCREASE FEES AND I AM VERY SURE OF IT AMONG
ALL 11 OF US. BUT AGAIN I JUST WANTED TO
ARTICULATE FOR EXAMPLE THAT THE BUILDING INSPECTION FEE BEFORE
YOU RAISE FUNDS ALL ACROSS BUT REALLY PARTICULARLY THAT WILL
BE INCLUSIVE OF THE CO ENFORCEMENT FOR SALE OF
BUILDINGS. I'M JUST GIVING YOU SOME
EXAMPLE WHAT ACTUALLY GOES BACK TO AGAIN TOGETHER A GENERATE
REVENUES AND IT BECOMES ASSUMPTION THAT WE MUST INCLUDE
AS BUDGET IF ANY OF THESE TRAILING LEGISLATION DO NOT
PASS PARTICULARLY SOME OF THESE FEES THAT I WANT TO AGAIN LET
YOU KNOW THAT IT REALLY WOULD IMPACT THE BUDGET IN ITS
ENTIRETY. >> SO EVEN THOUGH IT MAY NOT BE
SEEMS LIKE JUST A FEW MILLION DOLLARS HERE AND THERE BUT I
JUST WANT TO AGAIN TO ARTICULATE THAT POINT AND WHY
THEY ARE ACTUALLY GOING TOGETHER AND ALONG WITH THE
BUDGET AS TRAILING AND THAT IS WHAT I WANT TO TO MAKE SURE
THAT YOU ARE AWARE BEFORE WE DO SO.
>> SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU CHAIR JAN AND SO WITH
THAT MADAM CLERK, COULD YOU CALL THE ROLL ON THE ITEMS THAT
HAVE BEEN CALLED EXCLUDING SEVEN 15, 16, 2021 AND 31 OKAY.

ASKED THE BUDGET DIRECTOR SHE DOESN'T SEEM TO THINK WE NEED
TO DO THAT BUT I WANT TO ARTICULATE ON JULY 9TH THE
BUDGET DIRECTOR ACTUALLY HAS SENT US TECHNICAL ADJUSTMENTS
TO THE BUDGET AND THERE ARE TECHNICAL ADJUSTMENTS.
BUT I JUST WONDER RAISE THAT THAT IS PARTICULARLY FOR ITEM
SEVEN THERE ARE TECHNICAL ADJUSTMENTS SORRY FOR SEVEN
AND EIGHT THERE ARE TECHNICAL ADJUSTMENTS AND THAT SHOWS THE
FOR A FUNCTION AND IN THAT THE BOARD NEEDS TO ADOPT THEM BUT I

GENERALLY TRANSFER A FUNCTION MEMO IS A HEARING SO LET'S
RESCIND THE VOTE ON ITEM EIGHT EXCEPT THE TECHNICAL ADJUSTMENT

PRESENT AMENDMENT THANK YOU COLLEAGUES TO BE CLEAR I WANT
TO I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THIS ITEM BUT I DO WANT TO CLARIFY
THAT IT DOES NOT REPRESENT CITY FUNDING TO COMMUNITY
IMMIGRATION LEGAL DEFENSE SERVICES. >> IT REPRESENTS A DONATION BY A FOUNDATION FOR THE PUBLIC
DEFENDER'S OFFICE WHICH IS IS WELCOME.
>> WE NEED A LOT MORE PHILANTHROPIC SUPPORT TO FUND
IMMIGRATION LEGAL SERVICES EVERYWHERE AND I SUPPORT THIS
BUT THESE ARE TWO DIFFERENT THINGS CITY FUNDING, CITY
FUNDING FOR IMMIGRATION LEGAL DEFENSE SERVICES WAS KEPT AT A
BASELINE. I WAS AT 100 MONTGOMERY THIS MORNING. THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH COMMUNITY
DEPLOYED LAWYERS TO COVER EVERY IMMIGRATION COURT OR EVERY
PERSON WHO NEEDS TO PROCESS THEIR CASE AND COMMUNITY
DEFENSE ORGANIZATIONS LEGAL DEFENSE ORGANIZATIONS ARE
SPREAD SO THIN THAT WHEN ICE IS WAITING IN THE HALLWAYS FOR
PEOPLE VOLUNTEER COURT OBSERVERS EVERY DAY PEOPLE
NEIGHBORS ARE CALLING THE RAPID RESPONSE LINE TO CONNECT PEOPLE
WITH LAWYERS. IT'S A REACTIVE SYSTEM BECAUSE
PEOPLE ARE SPREAD SO THIN AND AT A TIME WHEN CONGRESS
JUST GAVE TRUMP $75 BILLION TO SCALE UP HIS ICE DEPORTATION
MACHINE, LAWYERS ARE BEING BURNED OUT.
>> THEY'RE EXPERIENCING SECOND HAND TRAUMA OF SEEING FAMILIES
RIPPED APART. THEY'RE THE ONES SHOWING UP ON
THE SCENE AT THE COURTS IN THE STREETS EVERY TIME OUR CITY
CALLS A RAPID RESPONSE LINE OR ATTORNEY OF THE DAY PROGRAM
AND THIS AMOUNTS TO A CUT. ALL THAT SAID, I DO SUPPORT
THIS AND WELCOME MORE OF THIS KIND OF SUPPORT FROM PHILANTHROPY FOR OUR PUBLIC DEFENDER AS WELL AS OUR

THOSE ITEMS. >> MADAM CLERK, COULD YOU
PLEASE CALL ITEM 36? ITEM 36 THIS ITEM WAS REFERRED
WITHOUT RECOMMENDATION FROM THE BUDGET AND APPROPRIATIONS
COMMITTEE. THIS IS AN ORDINANCE TO
AUTHORIZE THE CITY TO REALLOCATE APPROXIMATELY 34.7
MILLION IN PRIOR APPROPRIATED REVENUE AND UNAPPROPRIATED
EARNED INTEREST WITHIN THE OUR CITY OUR HOME A.K.A. LOCO FUND
TO ALLOW THE CITY TO USE REVENUES FROM THE HOMELESSNESS
GROSS RECEIPTS TAX THROUGH FISCAL YEAR 2026 THROUGH 27 FOR
CERTAIN TYPES OF SERVICES TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS
NOTWITHSTANDING THE EXPENDITURE PERCENTAGES SET FORTH IN THE
BUSINESS AND TAX REGULATIONS CODE SECTION 2810 WHERE FUTURE
REVENUE AND INTEREST TO THE FUND EXCEEDS AMOUNTS
APPROPRIATED IN THE ADOPTED BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEARS 2025
AND 2026 AND 2026 AND 2027 TO AUTHORIZE THE CITY TO EXPEND UP
TO 19.1 MILLION OF SUCH ADDITIONAL REVENUES AND INTEREST ON ANY PROGRAMS TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS AS
DESCRIBED IN THE BTR CODE SECTION 2810 WITHOUT REGARD TO
THE EXPENDITURE PERCENTAGES IN THAT SECTION AND TO
TEMPORARILY SUSPEND THE LIMIT ON FUNDING FOR SHORT TERM
RENTAL SUBSIDIES AND FINDING THAT THESE REALLOCATIONS ARE NECESSARY TO ACHIEVE THE PURPOSE OF THE OF THE OUR CITY
OUR HOME FUND PURSUANT TO THE BTR CODE SECTION 2811.
>> THANK YOU, MADAM CLERK. >> SUPERVISOR FIELDER THANKS,
PRESIDENT WILSON. COLLEAGUES WHILE I NEGOTIATE
ALLOCATIONS OF PROPERTY OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS ARE
IMPORTANT WINS. I'M DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE
PRESIDENT. THAT SECTION FOUR SETS SECTION
FOUR UP TO 20 MILLION DOLLARS FOR UP TO $20 MILLION WILL
ELIMINATE THE SUPERMAJORITY REQUIREMENT AT THE BOARD FOR
APPROVING FUTURE SURPLUS FUNDS. >> THIS IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM.
>> PROP C WAS INTENTIONALLY DESIGNED TO REQUIRE A
SUPERMAJORITY OF THE BOARD TO APPROVE SPENDING PLANS ENSURING
THAT REAL SOLUTIONS TO HOMELESSNESS LIKE HOUSING
AND HOUSING FOR FAMILIES AND YOUTH AREN'T SIDELINED IN FAVOR OF SHORT TERM FIXES OR POLITICAL WHIMS.
>> THIS REQUIRES IT IS A SAFEGUARD OF A VOTER APPROVED
CHECK ON ESPECIALLY MAYORAL POWER.
NOW WE'RE USING THAT VERY SUPERMAJORITY TO GIVE AWAY THIS
ESSENTIAL SAFEGUARD CARD. THAT'S NOT SOUND GOVERNANCE.
WHETHER IT'S UP TO 20 MILLION OR A DOLLAR REWRITING A VOTER
INITIATIVE LIKE THIS HAS NEVER BEEN DONE AND PASSED PROPERLY. TRAILING LEGISLATION AND SETS A DANGEROUS AND UNPRECEDENTED
EXAMPLE FOR OTHER VOTER INITIATIVES WITH A
SUPERMAJORITY TRUST BYPASSING SECTION FOUR WE'RE SETTING A
PRECEDENT THAT WILL BE HARD TO WALK BACK IN THE FUTURE IF THE
MAYOR HAS A THOUGHTFUL PLAN FOR SPENDING VOTER MANDATED FUNDING
FOR HOMELESS SERVICES, HE SHOULD BE ABLE TO PRESENT HIS
PLAN TO THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AND GAIN THE
SUPPORT OF A SUPERMAJORITY. >> THIS IS AN UNNECESSARY SCARY
MOVE THAT REPRESENTS AN ATTACK ON THE VOTER INITIATIVE PROCESS
AND THEREBY LOCAL DEMOCRACY. >> AND I HAVE TO ASK WHY IS
THIS BOARD OKAY WITH A MOVE THAT BLATANTLY DEFIES THE VERY
PRINCIPLES OF GOOD GOVERNANCE? >> WE LOVE TO TALK ABOUT
COLLABORATION HERE BUT IF COLLABORATION MEANS
STEAMROLLING LOCAL DEMOCRACY, YOU COUNT ME OUT.
>> AND WITH THAT PRESIDENT GENTLEMEN, I REQUEST TO HAVE
THE QUESTION DIVIDED FOR SECTION FOUR ON THIS ITEM.
>> ALL RIGHT. THERE'S BEEN A REQUEST TO DIVIDE THE QUESTION. VOTE SEPARATELY ON SECTION FOUR
OF THE ORDINANCE AND THE REMAINDER OF THE ORDINANCE AND I THINK THAT IS THE RIGHT OF ANY MEMBER TO REQUEST THAT.
SO WE WILL DO THAT WHEN THE TIME COMES.
>> SUPERVISOR WALTON THANK YOU PRESIDENT AMENDMENT AND NOT TO
REPEAT EVERYTHING THAT MY COLLEAGUES WHO WERE FIELD OR
SUPERVISOR FIELD HAVE STATED. I DO THINK THAT THIS BOARD HAS
BEEN VERY GENEROUS IN WORKING WITH THE MAYOR TO ALLOW FOR
FLEXIBILITY WITHIN OUR CITY OUR HOME POLICY FUNDING.
BUT I CANNOT SUPPORT WAIVING THE SUPER MAJORITY OR TWO
THIRDS THRESHOLD FOR ADDITIONAL REVENUE THAT MAY BE
REAPPROPRIATED IN THE FUTURE. >> I ALSO DON'T THINK THAT THIS
SHOULD HAVE BEEN A CONVERSATION A PART OF THE ENTIRE BUDGET
CONVERSATION. I REALLY THINK THAT THIS WAS THE WAY OF THE ADMINISTRATION TO TRY AND DIVIDE THIS BOARD OF
SUPERVISORS. THE FACT THAT WE ARE WILLING TO ALLOW THE MAYOR TO REAPPROPRIATE DOLLARS TO
DIFFERENT CATEGORIES IF ACCEPTABLE IS VERY REFLECTIVE
OF THIS BOARD'S COOPERATION AND THIS PROPOSAL HAS
DEFINITELY ALLOWED THE ADMINISTRATION THE FLEXIBILITY
THAT IT HAS REQUESTED. >> I ALSO WANT TO ADD THAT
EVERY DICTATOR STATES THAT THEY JUST WANT ADDITIONAL AUTHORITY
ONCE AND THEN THEY KEEP PRESSING THIS ADMINISTRATION,
ASK THIS BOARD TO WAIVE CERTAIN POWERS FOR THE FIT AND ALL
CRISIS AND THEN CAME BACK DURING THIS BUDGET PROCESS
AND ASKED US TO CONTINUE TO WAIVE OUR CHARTER GIVEN
AUTHORITY. AGAIN, THE MORE THE
ADMINISTRATION PUSHES TO TAKE AWAY THE WILL OF THE VOTERS
AND UNDERMINE THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT, THE MORE THEY WILL CONTINUE TO REQUEST TO UNDERMINE AUTHORITY MOVING
FORWARD. >> THIS BUDGET IS ALREADY REFLECTIVE OF COOPERATION BY THIS BOARD OF SUPERVISORS
IN THE MAYOR'S OFFICE. >> OUR MAYOR ALREADY HAS A LOT
OF POWER IN THIS CITY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CHARTER.
WITHOUT THIS BODY ALLOWING MORE NO KINGS APPLIES TO SAN
FRANCISCO AS WELL. WE CANNOT MISUSE VOTER
RESOURCES WITHOUT CHECKS AND BALANCES.
>> SO I WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING THIS ITEM.
>> CHAIR CHAN THANK YOU. PRESENT AMENDMENT AND THANK YOU
SUPERVISOR FIELDER FOR DIVIDING THE QUESTION SO THAT WE CAN
HAVE THIS DISCUSSION. COLLEAGUES I WANTED TO SPEAK TO THE EVOLUTION OF THIS LEGISLATION FROM WHERE WE
STARTED FROM AND WHERE WE ARE TODAY.
THIS LEGISLATION'S FIRST DRAFT INCLUDED IN REALLOCATION OF $88
MILLION IN INTEREST AND UNENCUMBERED PROPOSITION C
OUR CITY OUR ALL HOME FUNDS TO THE SHELTER AND HYGIENIC CARE
CATEGORY PROPOSED BY MAYOR LURIE.
BUT WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE HOMELESS FAMILIES TRANSITIONAL
ACTIVE AS WELL AS THOSE LIVING IN RVS WHO NEED IMMEDIATE
ASSISTANCE TO BE HOUSE NOT JUST TO BE SHELTERED.
AFTER MANY HOURS OF CONVERSATIONS WITH STAKEHOLDERS. THE MAYOR, HIS POLICY CHIEF
KUNAL MODI HSA DEPARTMENT OF HOMELESSNESS AND SUPPORTIVE
HOUSING DIRECTOR SHERRY MS. BIDEN AND HER TEAM.
WE NOW HAVE THE LEGISLATION THAT IS BEFORE US TODAY.
IT IS IN MY OPINION AND PROPOSAL WITH A BALANCED APPROACH TO HELP THE MOST VULNERABLE IN OUR CITY.
INVESTING IN HOUSING PEOPLE AND GIVING THEM SHELTER.
OUR NEGOTIATION THROUGHOUT THE BUDGET PROCESS HAVE RESULTED AS
I MENTIONED EARLIER IN ADDING AN ADDITIONAL $17.3 MILLION
IN SPENDING FOR FAMILY ROBERT HOUSING FOR TOTAL ALMOST $30
MILLION AN ADDITIONAL $9.5 MILLION WORTH OF ROBERT
REHOUSING FOR TRANSITIONAL AGING OF AND FOR A TOTAL OF $19
MILLION AN ADDITIONAL $3 MILLION FOR RV INTERVENTIONS AND HOMELESS PREVENTION MEASURES AN ADDITIONAL 9
MILLION FOR MEDIUM TERM HOUSING FOR A TOTAL OF 21 MILLION
AND AN ADDITIONAL 3.4 MILLION FOR HOUSE FOR HOTEL VOUCHERS
FOR TRANSITIONAL YOU AND ADULTS. THAT IS ALL IN ADDITION TO THE MAYOR'S PROPOSED INCREASE FOR
FUNDING FOR SHELTER AND HYGIENE CARE FOR FAMILIES AND ADULTS.
THE MAYOR'S ORIGINAL PROPOSAL ALSO INCLUDES A CLAUSE TO ALLOW
HIS OFFICE TO REALLOCATE ANY AND ALL FUNDING OVER PROJECTED
REVENUE TO ANY INITIATIVES HE PRIORITIZES.
WITH THE SCOPE OF PROP C FUNDING FOR THE NEXT THREE
FISCAL YEARS WITH A SIMPLE MAJORITY VOTE OF THE BOARD OF
SUPERVISORS. SO I AGREE AND I CONCUR
UNDERSTANDABLE AT LEAST SO THAT THIS CLAUSE CAUSE A LOT OF
CONCERN. SO WE ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS BY
AMENDING THE LEGISLATION MAINLY SECTION FOUR TO PLACE A CAP OF
$19 MILLION ON THE AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL REVENUE THAT WOULD
BE ELIGIBLE FOR REALLOCATION BY A SIMPLE MAJORITY AS WELL AS
LIMITING THE AUTHORITY TO THE END OF FISCAL YEAR 2627.
ANY ADDITIONAL CHANGES TO THE CURRENTLY PROJECTED
AND BUDGETED $370 MILLION OF OUR CITY OUR HOME PROP C FUNDS
WILL STILL REQUIRE A SUPERMAJORITY VOTE FROM THIS
VERY SAME BODY. >> I UNDERSTAND THOUGH THIS IS
NOT EVERYTHING SOME STAKEHOLDERS WANT IT AND OUR
SOUP AND SOME OF OUR SUPERVISORS TO AND I THANK THEM
FOR THEIR VERY GOOD FIGHT AND IT CERTAINLY ISN'T
EVERYTHING THAT THE MAYOR AND HIS TEAM WANTED.
AND I WANT TO THANK HIM AND HIS TEAM FOR HIS PARTNERSHIP.
FOR THEIR PARTNERSHIP. BUT I KNOW THAT THESE
AMENDMENTS REPRESENTED A BALANCED PROPOSAL AND THAT YOU
KNOW AND I MOVE THAT DAY JUST IN GOOD FAITH.
IT WAS IT WAS NOT EASY. BUT I MUST SAY INSTEAD OF
HOLDING UP THESE SORELY NEEDED FUNDS WITH A PARLIAMENTARY
DEBATE, I WANT TO SEE THIS FUNDS SPENT NOW TO ENSURE WE
INVEST IN PROGRAMS VITAL TO PROVIDE HOUSING FOR FAMILIES,
TRANSITIONAL AGE YOUTH AND GIVING SHELTER FOR PEOPLE
WHO ARE SUFFERING ON OUR STREETS NOT FIVE YEARS FROM NOW
OR WHEN POLITICS WORK FOR A SUPERVISOR INSTEAD OF SIX.
BUT I DO UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS AND WITH THAT I DO
WANT TO TO ALSO POINT OUT AGAIN THIS IS LIMITED TO 19 MILLION
FOR THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR THROUGH 2026, 2027.
I DO WANT TO ALSO POINT TO JUST THE DOCUMENTS THAT IS ON OUR
LEGISLATIVE FILE JUST SO THAT AGAIN EVERY EVERYONE CAN SEE
WHERE THE MONEY IS GOING AND IT'S ACTUALLY ON THE
LEGISLATIVE FILE FOR THIS PARTICULAR LEGISLATION.
AND IT'S UNDER THE CATEGORY OF PROP C BUDGET SUMMARY.
AND I ALSO WANT TO FLAG THAT THERE'S A COLUMN SPECIFICALLY
SHOW YOU AND INDICATE WHAT THE BOARD HAS DONE THROUGH THE
BUDGET NEGOTIATION AND WITH THIS LEGISLATION WHAT IT COMES
WITH AND THAT THERE ARE SPECIFIC NOTES THAT IN ZENO'S
SECTION THAT INDICATE WHAT IT ACTUALLY ALSO MEANS FOR THE
SPENDING SO THAT THERE IS A EXPLANATION, FOR EXAMPLE, THAT
THE INCREASE OF FUNDING FOR FOR MY APOLOGIES FOR MEDIUM TERM
HOUSING SUBSIDIES OF THAT INCREASE WILL ALSO INCLUDE A
100 ADULT RAPID REHOUSING SIDES FOR RV STRATEGY.
SO I AGAIN I JUST WANTED TO INDICATE THAT IT IS
UNDERSTANDABLY SO THAT THERE'S OBJECTION TO THE SECTION FOR
LANGUAGE AND AGAIN NOT WITH OUR STRUGGLE TO SAY THAT IS WHERE
I'M LENDING. BUT I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT
TAKING A STEP BACK TO LOOK AT THE ENTIRE CONTEXT OF BUDGET
AND THE ENTIRE CONTEXT OF THE AD FUND THAT WILL BE SPENT FOR
THE PROP C FUNDS, I WILL BE VOTING IN SUPPORT OF THIS THE
SECTION FOUR LANGUAGE AS AMENDED AT THE BUDGET COMMITTEE
AND ALSO THE LEGISLATION AS A WHOLE. >> THANK YOU. >> THANK YOU CHAIR CHAN.
SUPERVISOR CHEN THANK YOU PRESIDENT I AGAIN I WANT TO
THANK THE BUDGET CHAIR FOR HER DILIGENT WORK OF OVERSEEING OUR
BUDGET PROCESS. THIS WAS OUR FIRST TIME FOR
MANY OF US ON THIS BODY AND THE LEADERSHIP THAT CHAIR CHEN
DISPLAYED IT WAS INVALUABLE AND RESTORING MANY OF THE
DIRECT ESSENTIAL SERVICES THAT WAS CUT I THINK OVER THE LAST
COUPLE WEEKS I RECEIVED THOUSANDS OF EMAILS THIS ISSUE
NOW COMES DOWN TO THE BASIC PRINCIPLE OF GOOD GOVERNMENTS
AND GOOD GOVERNANCE AND I BELIEVE IN CHECK AND BALANCE
BETWEEN THE BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT. I BELIEVE THAT IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO ALWAYS UPHOLD THE
WILL OF THE VOTERS AND IF ONLY FOR THE SAKE OF MAINTAINING OUR
PUBLIC TRUST. AND I BELIEVE THAT I MYSELF
HAVE PLACED GREAT TRUST IN THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH IN MY LAST SIX
MONTHS FULL AS THE SUPERVISORS AND ALSO THIS BOARD ALSO HAS
DEMONSTRATED STRONG COLLABORATION WITH THE MAYOR'S OFFICE AT THIS POINT I REALLY APPRECIATE ALL THE ROBUSTNESS
CAUTION THAT HAS OCCURRED AROUND THIS ITEM AND AND THAT
WE CONTINUE TO ABLE TO DISAGREE RESPECTFULLY BUT TODAY I AM
CONTINUE REGARDLESS HOW I VOTE BUT I'M STILL CONTINUE TO
COMMIT TO WORK CLOSELY WITH ALL MY COLLEAGUES AND THE MAYOR'S
OFFICE TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE NEIGHBORHOODS SUPPORTIVE
COMMUNITY AS I ALSO BELIEVE THAT SAN FRANCISCO IS ON THE
RISE THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE SURE THAT
WE HAVE A BALANCED APPROACH TO NOT ONLY THE BUDGET BUT FOR THE
ITEMS THAT IT'S COMING TO THE BOARD AND THE FUTURE.
>> THANK YOU. THANK YOU.
SUPERVISOR CHEN SEEING NO ONE ELSE ON THE ROSTER I WILL OFFER
A FEW COMMENTS OF MY OWN. I AGAIN WANT TO THANK CHAIR
CHAN FOR HER FOR HER WORK ON ON THIS LEGISLATION.
I THINK THIS LEGISLATION IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY FOR THE
CONVERSATIONS AND COLLABORATION BETWEEN THE BOARD OF
SUPERVISORS AND THE MAYOR'S OFFICE AND I WANT TO THANK THE MAYOR'S OFFICE AND ESPECIALLY KUNAL MODI FOR THEIR
WILLINGNESS TO ENGAGE AROUND SOME OF THE CONCERNS WE WERE
EXPRESSING THAT ADVOCATES WERE EXPRESSING. SO I, I, I THINK THIS LEGISLATION GOT BETTER BY A LOT
AND I AM HAPPY TO SUPPORT IT. >> I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT BOTH
PARTS OF THE DIVIDED QUESTION TODAY I WOULD HAVE SUPPORTED
SECTION FOUR IN ITS ORIGINAL INCARNATION FROM MY PERSPECTIVE
AND I DID SUPPORT AND CAMPAIGN FOR PROP C IN 2018 THE
ALLOCATIONS THAT WERE LAID OUT IN PROP C IN 2018 WERE PLACED
THERE BY THE AUTHORS WERE NOT CENTRAL TO THE VOTERS
DELIBERATIONS OR THINKING ABOUT WHETHER TO IMPOSE THIS TAX
AND ARE NOW SEVEN YEARS OLD WHETHER OR NOT THEY WERE THE RIGHT FORMULA, WHETHER IT WAS THE RIGHT FORMULA IN 2018 IS
DEBATABLE. LOOKING BACK ON WHAT WE HAVE DONE WITH THOSE FUNDS OVER THAT TIME, I THINK THAT THOSE
ALLOCATIONS PUSHED US TO OVERINVEST IN PCH RELATIVE TO
OTHER TYPES OF HOMELESSNESS INTERVENTIONS THAT WE COULD
HAVE INVESTED IN DURING THAT TIME.
I WOULD BE WILLING TO DO ANYTHING WITHIN WHAT IS ALLOWED
BY THE LAW TO ALLOW THE MAYOR AND THIS BOARD OR FUTURE
BOARDS TO RATIONALIZE OUR SPENDING OF PROPERTY DOLLARS
AND SPEND THOSE DOLLARS BASED ON NEED AS WE IDENTIFY THEM
IN ANY PARTICULAR YEAR THROUGH A PROCESS THAT INVOLVES THE
MAYOR AND THE BOARD. BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT IS
IN SECTION FOUR AT THIS POINT THANKS TO THE MUCH MORE I GUESS
MODERATE PERSPECTIVE OF OUR CHAIR NOT THE EXTREME POSITION
OF PRESIDENT MANDELSON. WHAT IS INCLUDED IS A PROVISION
THAT WOULD ALLOW ADDITIONAL FUNDS THAT MIGHT COME IN UP TO
A TOTAL CAP OF LESS THAN $20 MILLION TO BE SPENT BY THE
MAYOR AND THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS IN THE SECOND YEAR
OF THIS BUDGET SUBJECT TO A MAJORITY VOTE.
THAT IS WHAT THIS ISSUE IS AND I AM COMPLETELY COMFORTABLE
GIVING THE MAYOR AND HIS TEAM THE ABILITY TO PROPOSE
PROGRAMING THOSE FUNDS IN NEXT YEAR'S BUDGET SUBJECT TO A
MAJORITY VOTE OF THIS BOARD OF SUPERVISORS.
IF WE ARE SO FORTUNATE THAT WE HAVE SOME OF THOSE FUNDS
AND AGAIN IF THOSE COME IN AT MORE THAN $20 MILLION WE WILL
BE BACK IN OUR TWO THIRDS CONVERSATION EVEN THOUGH PRESIDENT RANDLEMAN BELIEVES WE PROBABLY SHOULD TRY TO GET
BEYOND THE TWO THIRDS CONVERSATION ON THOSE
ALLOCATIONS WITH THAT, MADAM CLERK.
>> MR. PRESIDENT, IF I COULD JUST DRAW THE MEMBER'S
ATTENTION TO THE BLURB ON THE AGENDA UNDERNEATH THE REFERRED
WITHOUT RECOMMENDATION FROM BUDGET AND APPROPRIATION
COMMITTEE FOR ITEM 36. THIS REQUIRES AN EIGHT VOTE
THRESHOLD. WE HAVE DIVIDED OUT SECTION
FOUR AND FOR THE RECORD THAT IS FOUND ON PAGE FIVE LINE 20 TWO
THROUGH PAGE SIX, LINE SIX THE ENTIRETY OF SECTION FOUR AS
THIS IS AN EIGHT VOTE THRESHOLD FOR THE DIVIDED PORTION AS IT
IS FOR THE ORDINANCE. THE QUESTION IS THE SAME FOR
BOTH ITEMS. THE QUESTION IS SHALL THIS
ORDINANCE BE PASSED ON FIRST READING WHICH MEANS IF YOU ARE
IN SUPPORT OF THIS ORDINANCE YOU'RE IN SUPPORT OF THE
DIVIDED SECTION YOU WILL VOTE I IF YOU ARE AGAINST IT YOU WILL
YOU WILL VOTE NO. JUST FOR THE RECORD I'M GETTING
QUESTIONS ON HOW TO VOTE FOR THIS MATTER. >> THANK YOU MADAM CLERK. SUPERVISOR JOHN.
>> MADAM CLERK SO WE ARE VOTING ARE WE SEPARATING BOTH?
>> WE'RE VOTING SEPARATELY. SEPARATELY.
BUT IF I VOTE YES THEN I CAN STILL VOTE NO ON THAT AS A
WHOLE. >> CERTAINLY. OKAY. GOT IT. THANK YOU. OKAY. AND MADAM CLERK, DO YOU HAVE ANY PREFERENCE ON WHETHER WE
VOTE ON SECTION FOUR FIRST OR THE REMAINDER? >> TYPICALLY WHEN WE DIVIDE THE QUESTION WE DIVIDE WE VOTE FOR
THE DIVIDED PORTION FIRST AND THEN ON THE BALANCE OF THE
ORDINANCE WITHOUT THE DIVIDED PORTION OF IT DOES NOT PASS.
>> ALL RIGHT. SO SECTION FOUR, CAN YOU CALL
THE ROLL ON SECTION FOUR FIRST? >> YES, ON FOUR.
ITEM 36 JUST FOR SECTION FOUR FOUND ON PAGE FIVE, LINE 22
THROUGH PAGE SIX, LINE SIX. SUPERVISOR CHEN CHEN NO.

THE VOTES ON THE DIVIDED PORTION AND ON THE REMAINDER.
BUT THAT AS A WHOLE THE ITEM WILL SHOW AS PASSED ON FIRST
READING. >> ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU, MADAM CLERK. AND YOU PLEASE CALL ITEM 39
ITEM 39 THIS IS AN ORDINANCE TO AMEND THE ADMINISTRATIVE
AND EMPLOYMENT CODE TO UPDATE CITY PROCESSES AND REQUIREMENTS
. THANK YOU, MADAM CLERK. NOW I WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK ON THIS ITEM AND SO I'M GOING TO
TRADE PLACES WITH SUPERVISOR WALTON AND THEN SUPERVISOR
WALTON HAS SOME THINGS I THINK HE WOULD LIKE TO DO TO THIS
ITEM AND SO WE WILL TRADE BACK AND WE MAY DO THAT PERHAPS MORE
THAN ONCE TODAY PRESIDENT AND MADAM IN THANK YOU.
>> SUPERVISOR WALTON AND AND COLLEAGUES WE'RE GOING TO TALK
ABOUT THIS ITEM TODAY MORE THAN I HAD HOPED THAT WE WOULD.
>> BUT I DO WANT TO DO A LITTLE BIT OF REMINDING FOLKS WHO MAY
NOT HAVE HAD TO PAY TOO TERRIBLY MUCH ATTENTION TO THIS
LEGISLATION. WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE TODAY I
THINK YOU ALL MAY KNOW THAT I HAVE BEEN INTERESTED IN THE
CITY'S CHALLENGES AROUND CONTRACTING FOR SOME TIME.
WE DO MUCH OF OUR WORK THROUGH PROCUREMENTS.
SOMETHING LIKE A THIRD OF OUR CITY BUDGET IS SPENT THROUGH
PROCUREMENTS AND CONTRACTS AND I THINK THERE IS A GENERAL
SENSE OR AT LEAST MAY NOT THE UNIVERSAL BUT I BELIEVE AND I
THINK A LOT OF FOLKS BELIEVE THAT OUR CONTRACTS ARE SIMPLY
TOO COMPLICATED, THAT THEY TAKE TOO LONG, THAT THEY DISCOURAGE
LOTS OF FOLKS FROM DOING BUSINESS WITH THE CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO THAT THEY ARE NOT ADVANCING THE
PUBLIC INTEREST AND SO THAT WE SHOULD TRY TO FIND WAYS TO
SIMPLIFY OUR PROCUREMENT. I DID SOME WORK ON THAT OVER
WHAT TOOK A COUPLE OF YEARS TO REPEAL ADMINISTRATIVE CODE
CHAPTER 12 X THAT WAS THE LEGISLATION BACK IN I THINK
2015 THAT SAID THAT SAN FRANCISCO WOULD NOT DO BUSINESS WITH BUSINESSES LOCATED IN STATES THAT WERE BASED ON
LGBT RIGHTS. THAT WAS EXPANDED TO INCLUDE STATES THAT WERE ABOUT ON REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS AND THEN
ULTIMATELY STATES THAT WERE BASED ON VOTING RIGHTS AND BY THE END OF IT WE HAD 30 STATES WHERE WE GENERALLY WOULDN'T DO
BUSINESS WITH THOSE BUSINESSES. >> BUT THEN WE HAD A LITTLE COTTAGE INDUSTRY OF WAIVER PROCESSING WHERE WE ACTUALLY
MIGHT DO BUSINESS WITH BUSINESSES LOCATED IN THOSE
STATES BUT WE WOULD CERTAINLY SPEND A LOT OF TIME ENERGY
AND EFFORT GETTING THERE. SO I THINK CORRECTLY WE
REPEALED 12 X BUT IN THE PROCESS OF DOING THAT AND I
WHAT I DECIDED I WANTED TO TRY TO DO MORE AND IN 2022 I
SUBMITTED A LETTER OF INQUIRY TO THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR
ASKING HER TO PROVIDE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR A MORE TRANSPARENT, STREAMLINED AND LESS COSTLY PROCUREMENT
PROCESS FOR LOW DOLLAR CONTRACT TO ENCOURAGE GREATER
COMPETITION AND SUPPORT OUR CITY'S SMALL BUSINESSES.
IN MAY OF 2024 THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR CARMEN CHU WERE RELEASED A REPORT AND HER REPORT FOUND A NUMBER OF
THINGS. FIRST, LOW VALUE CONTRACTS ARE SUBJECT TO THE SAME CONTRACTING REQUIREMENTS AS HIGHER VALUE
CONTRACTS MAKING EXECUTING A $10,000 CONTRACT OFTEN JUST AS
DIFFICULT AS EXECUTING A $10 MILLION CONTRACT TO.
IN THE PAST FIVE YEARS THE CITY HAD AWARDED THOUSANDS OF
CONTRACTS FOR $200,000 OR LESS. THAT ACCOUNTED FOR 59% OF THE
CITY'S CONTRACT VOLUME BUT ONLY 1.8% OF THE CITY'S TOTAL
CONTRACT SPENDING MEANING THAT OUR STAFF AND SUPPLIERS WERE
SPENDING AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF TIME, ENERGY AND EFFORT ON A
RELATIVELY SMALL SHARE OF THE CITY'S SPENDING.
THREE THE CURRENT THE CITY'S CURRENT CONTRACTING PROCESSES
AND REQUIREMENTS CREATE A HIGH LEVEL OF ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN FOR BOTH CITY STAFF AND SUPPLIERS, MAKING IT MORE
DIFFICULT FOR THE CITY TO SERVE THE PUBLIC THE CITY'S
CONTRACTING AND FOR THE CITY'S CONTRACTING REQUIREMENTS MAKE
DOING BUSINESS WITH THE CITY CONFUSING AND THE COST
PROHIBITIVE FOR SOME SUPPLIERS AND SMALL AND LOCAL BUSINESSES
AND NONPROFITS ARE ESPECIALLY IMPACTED BY HIGH BARRIERS TO ENTRY WHICH CAN RUN COUNTER TO THE CITY'S GOALS OF LOCAL
INVESTMENT AND EQUITABLE CONTRACTING.
FIVE AND FINALLY THE COMPLEXITY OF THE CITY'S CONTRACTING
PROCESSES ARE AS I SUGGESTED, LIMITING COMPETITION TO PROVIDE
CITY GOODS AND SERVICES. AND AS AN EXAMPLE IN FISCAL
YEAR 2023 NEARLY HALF THE SOLICITATIONS THE OFFICE OF CONTRACT ADMISSION ADMINISTRATION ISSUED RECEIVED
ONE RESPONSE OR NO RESPONSE AT ALL.
SO THAT'S NOT A COMPETITIVE PROCESS DESIGNED TO GET US THE BEST PRODUCT AT THE BEST PRICE. >> CITY ADMINISTRATORS REPORT
MADE FIVE RECOMMENDATIONS FIRST, IMPROVE THE INFORMAL
PROCUREMENT PROCESS WHICH REFERS TO PROCUREMENTS UNDER
WHAT IS CALLED THE CITY'S MINIMUM COMPETITIVE AMOUNT.
THAT'S CURRENTLY ABOUT 200,000 $230,000 BUT IT'S RESET EVERY
FIVE YEARS USING CPI TO SIMPLIFY THE CITY'S STANDARD
CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS WHICH ARE SIGNIFICANTLY LONGER THAN THOSE IN OTHER CITIES AND MUNICIPALITIES.
THREE AMEND THE CITY'S PROCUREMENT REQUIREMENTS TO
UPDATE AND RECONCILE INCONSISTENCY INCONSISTENT SEES
IN PROCESSES, THRESHOLDS AND TRIGGERS FOR STANDARDIZED
FUTURE PROCUREMENT LEGISLATION. AND FIVE INCREASE INTERDEPARTMENTAL COORDINATION IN CONTRACTING AND ALIGN POLICY
AND ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESSES ACROSS DEPARTMENTS.
NOW SOME OF THIS CAN BE DONE AT THE STAFF LEVEL AND I WANT TO
CONGRATULATE THE OFFICE CONTRACT ADMINISTRATION AND THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR FOR THE WORK THEY'VE DONE TO TRY TO
IMPLEMENT SOME OF THESE RECOMMENDATIONS. BUT SOME OF US REQUIRES OUR PARTICIPATION AND HELP
AND THAT'S WHERE THIS LEGISLATION THE OPEN FOR
BUSINESS ACT COMES IN DOES NOT FIX EVERYTHING AT ONCE.
IN FACT, I THINK IN A LOT OF WAYS THIS IS A VERY MODEST
MEASURE. SUPERVISOR DORSEY IN COMMITTEE
INDICATED THAT HE THOUGHT WE SHOULD BE DOING A WHOLE LOT MORE. I AGREE THAT WE SHOULD BE DOING
A WHOLE LOT MORE BUT I WANTED TO PUT OUT SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE DIGESTIBLE FOR THIS BOARD. STRETCH SOME OF OUR MUSCLES
IN THIS REGARD I KNOW SUPERVISOR MAHMOOD THIS YEAR
HAS ALREADY DONE SOME SOME PROCUREMENT REFORM AROUND
SOFTWARE AND I THINK WE ALL GOT TO KEEP LOOKING FOR WAYS TO
MAKE THIS GOVERNMENT MORE EFFICIENT, MORE EFFECTIVE AND I
THINK THAT ACTUALLY IS THE BEST WAY TO ADVANCE OUR SAN FRANCISCO VALUES. SO THE PACKAGE CLEANS UP
OUTDATED LAWS, STREAMLINE DUPLICATIVE PROCESSES, REQUIRES
FUTURE PROCUREMENT LEGISLATION TO UNDERGO MORE RIGOROUS REVIEW
AND IN THAT REGARD I HAVE AN AMENDMENT THAT I HAVE
CIRCULATED FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION AND I HOPE
ADOPTION TODAY AND SO THAT AMENDMENT YOU SHOULD HAVE BUT
IT RESPONDS TO AN OBSERVATION THAT OUR CLERK MADE AND I HAVE
PROPOSED THAT WHEN FUTURE LEGISLATION MAY HAVE AN IMPACT
IN COMPLEX FURTHER COMPLEXITY TYING OUR CONTRACTS THAT WE
SHOULD GIVE THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR AT LEAST 60 DAYS
TO ANALYZE THE POTENTIAL IMPACTS AND REPORT TO US TO LET
US KNOW WHAT WE ARE DOING BEFORE WE DO IT AND AT LEAST
GRAPPLE WITH THE CONSEQUENCES OF ADDING FURTHER COMPLEXITY. NOW OUR CLERK LOOKING OUT FOR THIS BOARD AND FUTURE BOARDS
ASKED WHAT HAPPENS IF THEY DON'T COME UP WITH A RESPONSE
IN THOSE 60 DAYS AND THIS THIS AMENDMENT WOULD ADDRESS THAT
ALLOWING I MEAN WE ALREADY ALLOWED THE PRESIDENT OF THE
BOARD TO GRANT AN EXTENSION BUT THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE DONE
PRIOR WITH THE AMENDMENT PRIOR TO THE EXPIRATION OF THE 60 DAY
DEADLINE AND IF IT IS NOT IF THE ANALYSIS IS NOT PROVIDED BY
THAT DEADLINE AND THE PRESIDENT HAS NOT GRANTED AN EXTENSION,
THEN THE BOARD WOULD BE A LOT WOULD BE EXPLICITLY ALLOWED TO
PROCEED WITH CONSIDERATION OF THE LEGISLATION WITHOUT THE
ANALYSIS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN HERE TODAY FOLKS. I'M CURIOUS TO SEE BUT WHATEVER
HAPPENS I THINK IF THIS THING IS NOT KILLED TODAY IT WOULD BE
GOOD TO MAKE THIS AMENDMENT AND I'LL STOP TALKING AND GO
BACK UP TO THE DESK PRESIDENT AMENDMENT IS THAT A MOTION TO
AMEND? >> I'LL MOVE. YEAH. WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE. YES, I MOVE THAT. GREAT. THANK YOU. AND I WILL CALL ON SUPERVISOR
WALTON IN A MOMENT. >> MR. PRESIDENT, WE CAPTURED
THE SECOND SUPERVISOR CHAN OKAY .
>> OKAY. THANK YOU, PRESIDENT MANDELMAN
,I DON'T HAVE A LONG SPIEL. I WOULD JUST LIKE TO MAKE A
MOTION TO SEND THIS ITEM BACK TO COMMITTEE WHILE WE WORK ON
LANGUAGE TO REMOVE ELIMINATING THE SWEATSHOP COMMITTEE, I
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE A CONVERSATION AGREEMENT ON THIS
AND WORK ON WHAT THAT AMENDMENT LOOKS LIKE, WHY WE WILL WANT TO
CONTINUE, WHY WOULD WE WANT TO DISCONTINUE A COMMITTEE THAT IS
INVOLVED WITH MAKING SURE THAT WE DON'T SUPPORT SWEATSHOPS
IN SAN FRANCISCO? I HAVE NO IDEA WHY BUT I'D LIKE
TO MAKE THAT MOTION TO SEND THIS ITEM BACK TO COMMITTEE.
SECOND. ALL RIGHT. THERE'S A MOTION FROM SUPERVISOR WALDEN.
IT HAS BEEN SECONDED BY SUPERVISOR MELGAR SUPERVISOR
CHEN I I'LL BE VOTING IN SUPPORT OF THAT BUT I WANTED
TO ARTICULATE THAT I WAS I VOTED AGAINST THE MOTION TO
FORWARD THIS TO A FULL BOARD SIMPLY BECAUSE WE DO HAVE A
DUPLICATED FILE AS WELL AT THE COMMITTEE AND THOUGHT THAT
THERE ARE A FEW THINGS WE COULD DO.
I THINK FIRST AND FOREMOST THAT I THINK I DO WANT TO THANK
PRESENT AMENDMENT FOR IN HIS ATTEMPT TO STREAMLINE THIS THAT
IT'S SO THAT WE CAN UPDATE A POLICIES THAT WAS YOU KNOW
INTRODUCE AND PASS A WHILE AGO BUT I BUT I DO THINK THAT THERE
ARE A LOT OF ISSUES WITH THAT AND I HAVE COMMITTED TO TO THIS
WHEN I WANT TO SAY MR. TIM PAULSON WHO IS THE FORMER SAN
FRANCISCO LABOR COUNCIL EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, REACHED OUT
HAVE ASKED ME TO READ A STATEMENT AND I'M GOING TO READ
THIS IN MY VOICE. BUT YOU MAY THIS IS A
STATEMENTS FROM MR. TIM PAULSON ALONG WITH FORMER ASSEMBLY
MEMBER AND FORMER BOARD PRESIDENT TOM AMMIANO,
PRESIDENT OF THIS BOARD. AND SO YOU CAN TRY TO HEAR THIS
IN THEIR VOICES AND I'M SURE FORMER BOARD PRESIDENT AMMIANO
WILL BE A LOT MORE ANIMATED THAN I AM WITH THIS STATEMENT.
AND I THINK AFTER TWO STATEMENTS AND I WANT TO
ARTICULATE THE REASON WHY I WILL BE WHY I HAVE ISSUES WITH
THIS LEGISLATION AND WHAT WE CAN DO TO TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE
AND SO IT'S A STRONGLY WORDED STATEMENT AND I'M PURELY JUST
READING FROM THEM THE PROPOSAL TO WEAKEN AGAIN THIS IS WHAT
MR. TIM PAULSON AND MR. TOM MARIANO THE PROPOSAL TO WEAKEN
THE HISTORIC SWEAT FREE LABOR STANDARD LEGISLATION AS WELL AS
ELIMINATE THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE IS AN UNACCEPTABLE
AND UNWARRANTED ATTACK ON THE WORKER RIGHTS STANDARDS
AND LEGISLATIVE LEGACY THAT SAN FRANCISCO HAS FOUGHT TO ADVANCE
AND UPHOLD. WE FIRMLY DEMAND IT DEMAND THAT
YOU PRESENT AMENDMENT TOWARD THIS LEGISLATION FROM
CONSIDERATION. BUT IF YOU CHOOSE TO CONTINUE DOWN THIS ANTI WORKER PATH WE URGE ALL SUPERVISORS TO VOTE NO
ON THIS ISSUE A VICE PRESIDENT THE CURRENT NARRATIVE OF HOW
GOVERNMENT IS THE PROBLEM FOR IMPROVING OUR ECONOMY HAS
BECOME A DISTURBING EXCUSE FOR GUTTING LABOR STANDARDS, LIVING
WAGES, HEALTH CARE, AFFORDABLE HOUSING, WORKER SAFETY, SICK
DAYS ALL THE STANDARD LABOR AND SAN FRANCISCANS FOUGHT FOR
AND ARE PROUD OF HAS NEVER AND I MEAN NEVER BEEN
STATISTICALLY OR EMPIRICALLY SHOWN TO BE AN IMPEDIMENT TO
FINDING CONTRACTORS CREATING JOBS, BUILDING AFFORDABLE
HOUSING OR STARTING A BUSINESS. IT'S USUALLY JUST AN EXCUSE TO
INCREASE EARNINGS AND PROFITS. SAN FRANCISCO HAS NOT BEEN
IMPACTED BY BUYING ANYTHING BECAUSE OF THIS ORDINANCE OR
THE SAGE OVERSIGHT OF THIS CITIZEN ADVISORY COUNCIL.
AGAIN WE ASK THAT YOU VOTE NO ON THIS PROPOSAL AND STAND
FIRMLY FOR MAINTAINING THE HISTORIC LABOR STANDARDS THIS
CITY HAS BEEN PROUD TO PROMOTE AND MAINTAIN.
I WANT TO CONCUR THE SENTIMENT THAT OFTEN LABOR STANDARDS
REALLY IS BUILT BY LAYERS AND LAYERS AND DECADES OF FIGHT
AND I THINK THAT WHEN THEY BEGIN TO CHIP AWAY IT'S ALSO
THROUGH PIECES A PIECE BY PIECE AND THEN IT NEVER DOES LIKE
SIGNIFICANTLY JUST THROWN AWAY. WELL MAYBE TRUMP WILL DO THAT
BUT I THINK I DO THINK THAT WE CAN WORK ON THIS.
I WILL BE IN SUPPORT OF SENDING THIS BACK TO COMMITTEE.
I WILL BE CONTINUE TO WORKING ON DUPLICATE A VERSION.
HOWEVER TECHNICALLY IT WILL WORK.
I AM ALSO READY TO BUT I DON'T THINK I'M READY LIKE I THOUGHT
I WAS GOING TO BE ABLE TO BE READY TO PROPOSE AND AMENDMENTS
TO ADD BACK THE ADVISORY GROUP TODAY AND SO THAT WE CAN YOU
KNOW MAKE THAT AMENDMENT AND DECIDE IF WE WE WOULD LIKE
TO MAKE THAT AMENDMENT AND THEN WE CAN VOTE ON THE LEGISLATION
. REGRETTABLY BASED ON MY CONVERSATION WITH OUR DEPUTY CITY ATTORNEY ABOUT ROSSI IS
NOT POSSIBLE TODAY. COULD WE POSSIBLY DO IT NEXT
WEEK? >> MAYBE I DON'T KNOW LIKE WE
COULD ALSO DO THAT IN COMMITTEE. I SO I, I THINK EITHER WAY I AM IN A SPACE WHERE I THINK THAT
WE CAN WORK ON THIS LEGISLATION .
WE CAN DO MORE OF IT. I THINK THE SPIRIT OF TRYING TO
MAKE IT WORK WITHOUT YOU KNOW, TAKING AWAY THE LABOR PRINCIPLE
OF SWEAT SHOP AND EVEN THE MACBRIDE PRINCIPLE I THINK
AGAIN IT'S REALLY WHERE WHERE I AM AT BUT I AM MORE THAN HAPPY
TO REEVALUATE HOW THE ADVISORY BODY CAN WORK BETTER.
THAT IS PROVIDING MORE TEETH TO THE BODY OR HOWEVER WAY THAT WE
CAN MAKE IMPROVEMENTS OF A LEGISLATION THAT BEEN AROUND
FOR A LONG TIME AND I FOR ONE WILL BE SAYING THAT WE COULD
ALWAYS UPDATE OUR LEGISLATION AND THAT'S WHAT THE ELECTION IS
ARE FOR. THAT'S WHAT SUPERVISORS ARE
HERE FOR. THAT'S OUR JOB AND I'M HAPPY TO
ROLL UP MY SLEEVES AND TO DO THAT WORK. >> THANK YOU. SUPERVISOR MAHMUD THANK YOU
PRESIDENT COLLEAGUES I'D LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF ITEM 39
IN ADDITION TO AS AMENDED AS PROPOSED BY PRESIDENT RANDLEMAN
BUT ALSO IN OPPOSITION TO THE DECISION TO SEND IT BACK TO
COMMITTEE. THE OPEN FOR BUSINESS CONTRACT
STREAMLINING ACT IS FROM MY PERSPECTIVE SIMPLE BUT
NECESSARY IN THE CITY'S PROCESS OF FIXING ONEROUS CONTRACTING
RULES ESPECIALLY FOR LET'S REMIND OURSELVES THESE ARE FOR
SMALL DOLLAR CONTRACTS. >> IT UNTANGLES SOME OF THE
BIRD'S NEST OF RULES THAT HAVE MADE OUR PROCUREMENT PROCESS
LENGTHY AND COMPLEX UNNECESSARILY SCARING OFF
POTENTIAL VENDORS ESPECIALLY LOCAL SMALL BUSINESSES WHO LACK
THE LEGAL AND COMPLIANCE STAFF TO SIFT THROUGH DISSONANCE SETS
OF STANDARDS AND THRESHOLDS BY STANDARDIZING THESE RULES
AND REMOVING OUTDATED REQUIREMENTS AND CUTTING BACK
ON DUPLICATIVE REGULATIONS, OUR PROCUREMENTS WILL INCENTIVIZE A
DIVERSE APPLICANT POOL EQUATING TO MORE OPPORTUNITY FOR LOCAL
BUSINESSES AND LOWERING COSTS FOR THE CITY AS WELL.
>> THIS WILL ALSO CUT DOWN ON CONTRACTING TIME AND MAKE
PROCESSING MORE EFFICIENT. >> THIS LEGISLATION IS NOT A
ONE AND DONE. >> IT ESTABLISHES A REVIEW OF
FUTURE PROCUREMENT LEGISLATION TO ENSURE WE EVALUATE ITS
IMPACT AS A CITY AND PREVENT OVERBURDENING GOING FORWARD.
>> AND COLLEAGUES, LIKE MANY OF YOU, WE WERE ELECTED TO THIS
OFFICE BECAUSE RESIDENTS WANT A CITY HALL THAT WORKS.
>> THEY'RE TIRED OF INEFFECTIVE POLICIES PREVENTING US FROM GETTING THE BASICS OF GOVERNMENT RIGHT.
>> SO THIS IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF THAT. AND WE CAN'T LET POLITICS GET IN THE WAY OF LOGICAL
IMPROVEMENTS TO THE WAY OUR GOVERNMENT WORKS.
SO I SUPPORT THIS LEGISLATION IN ITS CURRENT FORM WITH THE
ADDITIONAL AMENDMENT PROVIDED BY PRESIDENT RANDLEMAN BECAUSE
WE NEED TO SHIFT THE CULTURE AROUND PUBLIC PROCUREMENT TO ALIGN THE VALUES OF EQUITY, COMPETITION AND GOOD
GOVERNANCE. >> SO I THINK PRESIDENT
RANDLEMAN FOR TAKING THE LEAD ON MAKING THESE ESSENTIAL IMPROVEMENTS TO OUR PROCUREMENT AND CONTRACTING SYSTEM
AND LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK. I WANT TO THANK CARMEN CHU
AND THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR'S OFFICE FOR HELPING TO IDENTIFY THESE PROCESS IMPROVEMENTS AS WELL AND ACKNOWLEDGE THE NEARLY
PROBABLY OVER A YEAR OF WORK THAT'S ALREADY GONE INTO THIS
LEGISLATION. ALL THE DECISIONS
AND FRAMEWORKS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN IMPLEMENTED THAT I THINK IT'S READY FOR A VOTE TODAY.
SUPERVISOR AND ENGARDIO I WANT TO THANK PRESIDENT MELMAN FOR
THIS LEGISLATION THAT I'M PROUD TO SUPPORT BECAUSE IT'S GOOD
GOVERNANCE. WE DO NEED PROCUREMENT REFORM.
OUR CITY ADMINISTRATOR NEEDS IT. THIS IS GOOD LEGISLATION AND WE CAN DO MORE OF IT.
AND THAT SAID, I'VE BEEN HEARING A LOT OF CONCERN ABOUT
ONE COMPONENT OF IT THIS SWEATSHOP ADVISORY COMMITTEE
AND I CAN UNDERSTAND IT'S A VERY SENSITIVE TOPIC ESPECIALLY
FOR LABOR. IF YOU THINK BACK TO 1911 WITH
THE TRIANGLE SHIRTWAIST FACTORY FIRE, MORE THAN 100 WORKERS
WERE KILLED AND INCLUDING CHILDREN.
AND THIS KIND OF SET THE STAGE FOR THE LABOR MOVEMENT.
SO IT'S A VERY SENSITIVE ISSUE, ESPECIALLY SWEATSHOPS.
>> THERE IS MODERN DAY VERSIONS OF SWEATSHOPS THAT WE KNOW ABOUT SO TO ME IT FEELS LIKE IT'S A GOOD COMPROMISE TO LET
99% OF THIS GREAT LEGISLATION GO THROUGH ALL THE GOOD STUFF THAT WE NEED TO HAPPEN AND TAKE A PAUSE ON THE SWEATSHOP PART
AND TALK ABOUT THAT A LITTLE BIT MORE.
UM, LABOR WORKERS HAVE A LARGE CONCERN ABOUT IT AND RIGHTFULLY
SO. SO I'M COMFORTABLE WITH GOING
BACK TO COMMITTEE AND LETTING THE 99% THIS LEGISLATION GO
FORWARD AND CARVE OUT A LITTLE BIT FOR THIS SWEATSHOP ADVISORY
BOARD AND WE CAN TALK MORE ABOUT THAT.
>> SUPERVISOR DORSEY THANK YOU. PRESIDENT MANDELSON AS I SAID
IN COMMITTEE, YOU KNOW MY PERSPECTIVE ON THIS IS INFORMED
AND INFLUENCED BY A LONG TIME WORKING IN CITY GOVERNMENT
WHERE I WAS IN SITUATIONS WHERE I WAS GOING THROUGH CONTRACTING
PROCESSES AND ENCOUNTERING INEFFICIENCIES AND PRACTICES
THAT WERE INFURIATING TO ME AS A CITY EMPLOYEE BUT ALSO
ENCOURAGING TO ME ON BEHALF OF SAN FRANCISCO TAXPAYERS.
WE HAVE A IN EVERYTHING BAGEL KIND OF POLICY MAKING WHERE
YEARS OF WELL-INTENTIONED POLICIES AND PRACTICES HAVE
BEEN PILED INTO OUR CONTRACTING AND PROCUREMENT RULES.
CONTRACTING AND PROCUREMENT ISN'T THE ONLY WAY WE CAN ACCOMPLISH THE AIMS OF PUBLIC POLICY.
BUT WHAT WE HAVE DONE IN SAN FRANCISCO IS TO CREATE THIS
INCREDIBLY ONEROUS PROCESS AND I THINK IF SAN FRANCISCANS
HAD ANY IDEA HOW HOW WASTEFUL AND INEFFICIENT THIS IS, I
THINK THEY WOULD SHARE MY ANGER AT WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH.
>> AND I THINK IT'S ENTIRELY POSSIBLE THAT THIS PROCESS THIS
IS NOW THE SECOND TIME WE'VE TAKEN THIS UP SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE. THE FIRST WAS 12 X AND NOW
WE'RE HAVING THIS AGAIN. IT MAY BE THAT THE LESSON TO
COME OUT OF THIS IS THAT THIS IS A CONVERSATION THAT REALLY
NEEDS TO HAPPEN WITH VOTERS THAT THE ELECTORATE REALLY
NEEDS TO WEIGH IN BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY IT'S THEIR DOLLARS. I THINK IT'S ALSO WORTH
REMEMBER THAT IN THE LAST FIVE AND A HALF YEARS WE HAVE HAD
THREE EMERGENCIES COVID, THE TENDERLOIN EMERGENCY INITIATIVE
AND THE FENTANYL EMERGENCY AND OTHER THAN THE PROVISION OF
THE COVID EMERGENCY THAT ENABLED US TO DRAW DOWN FEDERAL DOLLARS, ALL OF THE EMERGENCY DECLARATIONS WE HAVE HAD HAVE
BEEN TO GET OUT OF OUR OWN WAY AND AT SOME POINT WHEN WE'VE
DONE THREE OF THESE IN FIVE AND A HALF YEARS, IT'S PROBABLY
GOOD THAT WE ASK THE QUESTIONS OF WHAT'S WRONG WITH OUR
PROCESS THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE AN EMERGENCY EVERY TIME WE NEED TO
GET SOMETHING DONE. AND I WILL SAY THAT THE THING
THAT TO ME WAS THE COUP DE GRAS THAT ALWAYS BOTHERED ME THE MOST ABOUT THIS IS THAT WHEN YOU'VE WORKED IN CITY
GOVERNMENT LONG ENOUGH YOU FIGURE OUT THAT THERE IS A WAY
IF YOU REALLY WANT TO GET A CONTRACT WITH A CERTAIN VENDOR
OR SERVICE OR GOOD THAT THERE'S ALWAYS A WAY TO GET SOMEBODY
ELSE TO DO TO GET AN APPROVED VENDOR TO SUBCONTRACT THE
UNAPPROVED VENDOR. WE HAVE TO DO THIS IN A WAY
THAT IS MORE EFFICIENT. I THINK WE COULD WE SHOULD
MAYBE I WOULD LIKE TO THINK THAT WE AS A BOARD OF SUPERVISORS CAN DO THIS AND IT'S A LESSON LEARNED IF WE
CAN'T BECAUSE I BUT I DO THINK THAT MANY OF THE DIFFICULT
DECISIONS THAT WE HAVE MADE IN THE BUDGET PROCESS INVOLVE
HOW MUCH MONEY WE ARE SPENDING FOR THE WORKERS AND THE
COMPLIANCE TO MAKE COMPETITIVE BIDDING LESS COMPETITIVE
AND GOODS AND SERVICES MORE EXPENSIVE. I THINK WE CAN DO BETTER. I APPRECIATE THE LEADERSHIP
THAT SUPERVISOR PRESIDENT RANDLEMAN HAS BROUGHT TO THIS
IN TRYING TO DO THAT AND I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THIS
LEGISLATION MOVING FORWARD. >> SUPERVISOR CHEN THANK YOU
PRESS AMENDMENT AND I DO SUPPORT SENDING IT BACK TO THE
COMMITTEE AND I THINK THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF THE SWEAT
FREE ORDINANCE WAS TO ENSURE THAT THE CITY DOLLARS BE SPENT
WITH RESPONSIBLE CONTRACTORS. >> SAN FRANCISCO PREVIOUSLY IT
WAS HOME TO MANY GARMENT FACTORIES IMMIGRANTS WITH
LIMITED JOB OPPORTUNITIES INCLUDING MANY OF MY FAMILY MEMBERS DEPENDED ON THIS JOBS FOR SURVIVAL GARMENT WORKERS
OFTEN PAY BY PIECE RE BEING PAY A FEW CENTS TO SEOUL EACH ITEM
WHICH OFTEN DOES NOT ADD UP TO THE LEGAL MINIMUM WAGE A
SQUABBLE IZATION FORCE COMMON MANUFACTURING OVERSEAS IT HAS
BECOME A RACE TO THE BOTTOM AS BUSINESS LOOK TO MANUFACTURING
THEIR GOODS IN COUNTRIES WITH THE MOST LAX LABOR PROTECTIONS.
>> THE SWEAT FREE ORDINANCE REQUIRES INDEPENDENT MONITORING
OF OVERSEAS FACTORIES WHEN OTHER CITIES, UNIVERSITIES
AND GOVERNMENT INSTITUTIONS ALL PARTICIPATE IN COLLECTIVE
MONITORING, THERE CAN BE SOME MINIMUM MINIMUM ASSURANCE THAT
CLOTHING AND UNIFORMS FOR THE CITY ARE NOT PRODUCED IT UNDER
SWEATSHOP CONDITIONS BY SUNSETTING THE SWAP FREE A
THREAT FREE ORDINANCE SAN FRANCISCO IS SETTING A BAD EXAMPLE AND SENDING A MESSAGE THAT LABOR STANDARDS ARE NOT A
PRIORITY. >> THANK YOU SUPERVISOR FIELDER
THANK YOU PRESIDENT MIDDLEMEN. I AM RESPECTFULLY, DEEPLY
DISAPPOINTED THAT THESE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO THE
SWEAT FREE CONTRACTING ORDINANCE WOULD RENEGE ON OUR COMMITMENTS TO PREVENTING ABUSIVE LABOR CONDITIONS IN THE
GLOBAL GARMENT INDUSTRY. >> THIS IS SOMETHING THAT
ADVOCATES AND LABOR HAS FOUGHT INCREDIBLY HARD FOR AND WOULD
REPRESENT A WHOLESALE RETREAT FROM PROTECTING WORKERS RIGHTS
AND PREVENTING SWEATSHOP ABUSES OVERSEAS.
>> THIS WOULD BE AN EMBARRASSING AND UNJUSTIFIED
STEP BACK FROM LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE AND COULD OPEN THE
POSSIBILITY OF OUR CITY BEING COMPLICIT IN THE EXPLOITATION
OF WORKERS WHO ASK FOR NOTHING MORE THAN TO BE PAID A WAGE
ABOVE THE LOCAL POVERTY LINE FOR THEIR COUNTRY.
WHILE I UNDERSTAND THE BENEFITS OF STREAMLINING AND REMOVING RED TAPE AND OUR CITY LAWS THAT MAKE IT HARDER TO DO BUSINESS,
WE CANNOT OPEN PANDORA'S BOX TO WORKER EXPLOITATION WHICH IS
WHY I WILL BE SUPPORTING SENDING US BACK TO COMMITTEE.
>> ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU. SUPERVISOR FIELDER AND COLLEAGUES, I WOULD LIKE TO
ADDRESS THE PROPOSED AMENDMENT AND ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO ONE
ELSE IN THE QUEUE I FEAR THAT AFTER I SPEAK THERE COULD BE SO
I PROBABLY SHOULD TRADE PLACES AGAIN WITH SUPERVISOR WALTON I
WILL CORRECT MYSELF. THE PROPOSED MOTION THERE IS NO
AMENDMENT. THERE MAY BE AN AMENDMENT WE DON'T KNOW WHERE THERE IS MY AMENDMENT WHICH I WHICH I WOULD
APPRECIATE IF WE COULD TAKE ACTION ON. >> ALL RIGHT. EARLIER TODAY I OBSERVE THE
THINGS THAT ARE SELF-EVIDENT TO SOME SUPERVISORS ARE ANATHEMA
TO OTHER SUPERVISORS. THIS IS ABSOLUTELY IN THIS
IN THAT CATEGORY IT IS SELF-EVIDENT TO ME THAT THE
SWEAT FREE PROCUREMENT ADVISORY COMMITTEE SHOULD GO AWAY. >> THE CONVERSATION ABOUT IT IN MY VIEW IS A BUNCH OF
NONSENSE. WHAT WE ARE NOT DOING WITH THIS
LEGISLATION IS ELIMINATING THE SWEAT FREE ORDINANCE.
WE ARE PRESERVING THE SWEAT FREE ORDINANCE. WE WILL STILL HAVE STAFF IN LSC DOING WORK TO ENSURE THAT THE
WORKING CONDITIONS OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE SUPPLYING OUR TEXTILES ARE GARMENTS THAT OUR DEPARTMENTS PURCHASE ARE STILL
BEING MADE IN A WAY THAT THAT COMPLIES WITH OUR SAN FRANCISCO
VALUES. THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO WOULD
QUERY WHETHER THAT IS REALLY THE BEST USE OF OUR PUBLIC
DOLLARS IN THIS CITY BUT I'M NOT TACKLING THAT. I'M NOT SAYING DO AWAY WITH THE MCBRIDE PRINCIPLES DO AWAY WITH
SWEAT FREE, DO AWAY WITH THE EQUAL BENEFITS ORDINANCE.
YOU COULD MAKE THAT CASE BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT IS IN THIS
LEGISLATION. WHAT IS IN THIS LEGISLATION ARE
SOME MODEST TWEAKS TO MAKE THESE PROVISIONS SLIGHTLY LESS
BURDENSOME AND ONEROUS FOR CONTRACTORS AND FOR OUR CITY
STAFF. THIS PARTICULAR BODY HAS
STRUGGLED TO MAKE QUORUM SINCE 2020.
>> THIS PARTICULAR BODY HAS NO VOTING OR LEGISLATIVE POWER.
IT IS COMPLETELY ADVISORY AND THE WORK OF ADVANCING OUR
SWEAT FREE PRIORITIES IS DONE BY STAFF NOT BY THE VOLUNTEERS
ON THIS ADVISORY GROUP. THIS BODY HAS EXISTED FOR 20
YEARS. >> THE NOTION THAT ONCE A BODY
THAT HAS A NAME THAT IDENTIFIES A VALUE THAT WE THINK IS
IMPORTANT SHOULD CONTINUE IN PERPETUITY IS NOT A GOOD
NOTION, IS NOT A NOTION THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH THE EFFECTIVE
DELIVERY OF SERVICES FOR OUR PUBLIC AND SO I ABSOLUTELY
OPPOSE STRONGLY PRESERVING THE SWEAT FREE ADVISORY GROUP.
I THINK IT IS ONE OF A NUMBER OF GROUPS THAT OUR PROPERTY
COMMISSION SHOULD BE PROPOSING ELIMINATION.
BUT MY CONCERN IS THAT THE DIFFICULTY THAT THIS BODY IS
HAVING EVEN ELIMINATING A GROUP THAT STRUGGLES TO MAKE QUORUM
INDICATES THAT WE ARE GOING TO STRUGGLE MIGHTILY TO ADVANCE
THE WILL OF THE VOTERS AROUND PROPERTY AND THE ELIMINATION OF COMMISSIONS AND ADVISORY GROUPS.
>> I DO NOT THINK THAT THERE IS A NECESSARY TENSION BETWEEN
ADVANCING OUR SAN FRANCISCO VALUES BETWEEN AND PROTECTING
OUR WORKERS AND ALSO HAVING AN EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE
GOVERNMENT. IN FACT I THINK WE HAVE TO DO
THAT BUT IT REQUIRES A WILLINGNESS TO TIPTOE UP TO OUR
SACRED COWS AND INQUIRE WHETHER THERE ARE SOME THINGS WE MIGHT
BE ABLE TO DO NOT NECESSARILY TO KILL THEM BUT TO MAKE THEM
WORK BETTER FOR SAN FRANCISCO. AND I AM CONCERNED THAT IF OUR
FRIENDS IN THE ADVOCACY WORLD AND IN LABOR ARE UNWILLING TO
TAKE THOSE STEPS WITH US THAT IT WILL FALL TO THE ELON MUSK'S
AND THE DONALD TRUMPS OF THE WORLD TO DO THAT WITHOUT ANY
PARTICIPATION FROM THE KINDS OF PEOPLE WHO WE THINK SHOULD BE
LEADING THOSE CONVERSATIONS. SO I'M A LITTLE HEATED ABOUT
THIS AND AS ALWAYS I, I RESPECT PEOPLE'S GOODWILL AND ABILITY
TO DISAGREE. I UNDERSTAND THAT NOT EVERYBODY
SEES THIS ISSUE IN THE SAME WAY THAT I DO, BUT THAT IS HOW THAT
IS HOW I SEE IT. AND WITH THAT I'LL GO BACK UP TO THE DAIS. >> ALL RIGHT, COLLEAGUES, I
MADE A MOTION AND IT WAS SECONDED BY CHIEF.
CAN WE TAKE THAT MOTION WITHOUT OBJECTION AND YOU WANT TO THIS
IS THE MANAGEMENT AMENDMENTS. >> OKAY.
THIS THIS IS THE AMENDMENT THAT WOULD ALLOW THE BOARD TO MOVE
FORWARD WITH CONSIDERING LEGISLATION AND IF THE CITY
ADMINISTRATOR HAS FAILED TO PROVIDE THE PROCUREMENT IMPACT
ANALYSIS STATEMENT WITHIN 60 DAYS AND THE BOARD PRESIDENT HAS NOT GRANTED AN EXTENSION OF THAT PERIOD.
SO WE'LL TAKE THAT MOTION WITHOUT OBJECTION THE MOTION
PASSES AND THEN THERE IS A MOTION ON THE FLOOR TO SEND
THIS ITEM TO COMMITTEE. IT WAS IT HAS BEEN MADE BY
SUPERVISOR WALTON SECONDED BY SUPERVISOR SUPERVISOR MELGAR.
>> MADAM CLERK, PLEASE CALL THE ROLL ON THE MOTION TO SEND ITEM

PASSES MADAM CLERK PLEASE CALL ITEM 40 ITEM 40 THIS IS AN
ORDINANCE TO AMEND VARIOUS CODES TO UPDATE PARKING RESTRICTIONS FOR LARGE COMMERCIAL VEHICLES AS WELL
AND AMENDING HOURS AND EXCEPTIONS AND TO AFFIRM
THE SECOND DETERMINATION SUPERVISOR MELGAR THANK YOU
PRESIDENT MANDELL MAN I WANTED TO PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT OF
CONTEXT ABOUT THIS LEGISLATION THAT WENT TO THE BUDGET
COMMITTEE. I HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE
MAYOR'S OFFICE FOR A FEW MONTHS TO GET US TO THIS POINT.
I WANT TO FIRST OF ALL THANK KUNAL MODY AND YOU FOR PAN FOR
THEIR A GENEROUS TIME AND AMAZING AMOUNT OF WORK ON
THIS LEGISLATION. IT WAS MORE WORK THAN I HAVE SEEN BEING SPENT ON THIS ISSUE FOR YEARS BEFORE.
YOU KNOW WE TACKLED IT HERE AND LAST YEAR THIS BODY UH
CONSIDERED AN APPEAL FROM ADVOCATES ON THE MTA A DECISION
TO RESTRICT PARKING OF A RECREATION NO VEHICLES IN THE
CITY AND I VOTED TO SUPPORT THAT APPEAL BECAUSE I DIDN'T
THINK THAT THE LEGISLATION CONSIDERED THE EXPERIENCES THAT
ME AND MY STAFF HAD HAD IN DEALING WITH THE ISSUE
IN DISTRICT SEVEN WE SPENT THE BETTER PART OF FOUR YEARS
TRYING TO HELP THE FOLKS WHO LIVING IN RECREATION
AND VEHICLES ON WINSTON AVENUE AND BUCKINGHAM BEHIND STONES
TOWN TO TRY TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN OBTAINING HOUSING PERMANENT
HOUSING THAT WAS NOT VEHICLES ON THE PUBLIC RIGHT AWAY WITH
TRAFFIC TRAVELING 40 MILES AN HOUR NEXT TO THEM AND WHAT WE
FOUND WAS REALLY DISHEARTENING. SO TO BEGIN WITH THE DEPARTMENT
H. S H DID NOT HAVE LANGUAGE
CAPACITY. MANY OF THE FAMILIES WERE
SPANISH AND PORTUGUESE SPEAKING IN THE SYSTEM MYSELF THE
COORDINATED ENTRY SYSTEM THAT THE DEPARTMENT WAS USING TO DO
HOUSING ASSESSMENT ON THESE FAMILIES DISADVANTAGED THEM
BECAUSE MANY OF THESE FAMILIES WERE JUST POOR AND DIDN'T SPEAK
ENGLISH AND WERE NEWCOMERS TO OUR COUNTRY.
SO WHAT HAPPENED IS YOU KNOW THEY WERE BEING ASSESSED AND D
PRIORITIZED BECAUSE THE FAMILIES WERE NOT DEALING WITH
MENTAL HEALTH. THEY WERE NOT DEALING WITH DRUG ADDICTION. THEY WERE NOT DEALING WITH A
LOT OF THE ISSUES THAT THE DEPARTMENT WAS SET UP TO
ADDRESS. NEVERTHELESS, WITH A LOT OF
HARD WORK WE WERE ABLE TO PLACE A LOT OF FOLKS INTO HOUSING
WITHOUT CHARGES AND I CONSIDER THAT A SUCCESS AT WHAT
HAPPENED. HOWEVER, IS THAT WE FOUND THAT
A LOT OF FAMILIES WERE LIVING IN VEHICLES THAT DID NOT THEY
DID NOT OWN BUT SOMEONE ELSE OWNED THEM AND WORE ON THE
PUBLIC RIGHT AWAY FOR FREE AND CHARGING A LOT OF MONEY FOR
RENT TO LIVE IN THESE VEHICLES AND TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE
DESPERATION OF PEOPLE. >> AND FOR EVERY FAMILY THAT WE
PLACED INTO HOUSING, MOST OF THEM IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD
SOMEONE ELSE WOULD TAKE THEIR PLACE.
THE DEPARTMENT DID NOT HAVE A SYSTEM TO KEEP TRACK OF WHO WAS
BEING PLACED AND WHO TOOK THEIR PLACE AND THE MTA AND THE H.
S H DEPARTMENT DID NOT HAVE A SYSTEM TO COORDINATE WITH EACH
OTHER. ONCE A FAMILY WAS PLACED
IN HOUSING TO RECUPERATE THE PUBLIC RIGHT OF WAY.
>> I WANT TO SAY THAT THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS I WAS
GRATEFUL FOR THE STAFF AT THE COALITION ON HOMELESSNESS IN LA
RAZA FAMILY RESOURCES CENTER WHO HELPED GOING DOOR TO DOOR
TO SPEAK WITH FAMILIES AND PROPERLY ASSESS THEIR
NEEDS. HOWEVER WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT
THE LACK OF PARKING RESTRICTIONS ALLOWED FOR OR THE
GROWTH OF THE AMOUNT OF VEHICLES PARKED ON THE STREET
WHICH WAS WHICH IS A PROBLEM FOR DISTRICT SEVEN BECAUSE
WINSTON AVENUE IS UPHILL FROM LAKE MOORSIDE WHICH IS OUR
SECOND DAIRY DRINKING WATER SOURCE IN CASE OF A DISASTER
FOLKS WERE USING GENERATORS TO KEEP WARM BECAUSE IT'S COLD
IN SAN FRANCISCO ESPECIALLY IN THE SUMMER AND THE
GENERATORS PRODUCE POLLUTION AND THEY ARE FED WITH GASOLINE
WHICH PEOPLE KEEP ON THE UNIMPROVED SIDEWALKS THAT HAVE
DRY GRASS AND VEGETATION AND IT IS A HAZARD FOR BOTH THE
FAMILIES LIVING IN THESE RV'S AND THE COMMUNITY AROUND THEM.
SO AFTER MANY YEARS OF WORK WE WERE ABLE TO COME UP WITH A
SYSTEM TO HELP THE FAMILIES. WE WERE LUCKY THAT AT PALMER
SAD HAD EMPTY APARTMENTS AND THEY WERE WILLING TO WORK
WITH THE DEPARTMENTS TO TAKE THE VOUCHERS AND TO BE ABLE TO
PUT FAMILIES IN THOSE APARTMENTS. HOWEVER IT IS A REGIONAL ISSUE. PEOPLE MOVE IN, RVS BACK
AND FORTH BETWEEN SAN MATEO COUNTY, SAN FRANCISCO COUNTY AND MARIN AND WE DO NOT HAVE A SYSTEM TO NOT JUST REGULATE BUT
ALSO SUPPORT THESE FAMILIES IN AN ADEQUATE WAY.
SO WHAT THIS LEGISLATION DOES THAT IS FURTHER THAN WHAT THE
LEGISLATION THAT WAS PRESENTED LAST YEAR IS AS FOLLOWS IT
CREATES A REFUGE PERMIT SYSTEM SO THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE LIVING
ON OUR STREETS CANNOT APPLY FOR A PERMIT TO STAY ON THE STREET
AS LONG AS THEY FOLLOW CERTAIN RULES IN THAT THOSE ARE
DISPOSAL OF WASTE BOTH HUMAN WASTE AND GARBAGE AND SORT OF
GOOD GOOD NEIGHBOR RULES AROUND YOU KNOW, HOW THEY INTERACT
WITH THE COMMUNITY AROUND THEM .
>> THOSE ARE SPECIFIED IN THE LEGISLATION AND THAT PERMIT CAN
GO UP TO SIX MONTHS AND THEN RENEW IT AS LONG AS THE FAMILY
IS WORKING WITH FOLKS IN THE DEPARTMENT TO TRY TO SECURE
HOUSING AND THEY ARE BEING GOOD NEIGHBORS AND THAT WILL ALLOW
US TO KEEP TRACK OF WHO IS ON THE STREET AND MAKE SURE THAT
PEOPLE DON'T FALL THROUGH THE CRACKS TO ALLOW AGENCIES TO
ASSIGN CASEWORKERS TO KEEP A LIST OF HOW PEOPLE ARE
PROGRESSING IN IN THEIR QUEST TO GAIN PERMANENT HOUSING.
IT ALSO HAS A BUYBACK PROGRAM FOR FOLKS WHO YOU KNOW, DON'T
HAVE ANY PLACE TO STORE THEIR VEHICLES AT BUT WANT TO
MONETIZE THAT ASSET TO HELP THEM IN ADDITION TO GETTING A
SUBSIDY AND A DEPOSIT FOR A DEPARTMENT.
>> SO I THINK THAT THIS LEGISLATION IS A GREAT PROGRESS
OVER WHAT WAS PROPOSED LAST YEAR WHICH WAS ESSENTIALLY JUST
A RESTRICTION. I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE
MAYOR'S OFFICE FOR WORKING WITH MTA TO IN ADDITION TO
RESTRICTING THE VEHICLES WHERE PEOPLE ARE LIVING, WE ARE
RESTRICTING LARGE VEHICLES. SO IN DISTRICT SEVEN WE ALSO
HAVE A PROBLEM WITH FOLKS WHO ARE COMMERCIAL BUSINESS OWNERS
WHO PARK IN UNRESTRICTED AREAS OF OUR CITY FOR FREE INSTEAD OF
PAYING FOR PARKING SOMEWHERE ELSE.
AND THAT BRINGS ALL SORTS OF ISSUES AND THE SAFETY OF OUR
STREETS FOR BIKES, FOR PEDESTRIANS, FOR EVERYONE WHO
USES IT. YOU KNOW SAN FRANCISCO'S A VERY SMALL CITY REALLY AT SEVEN BY SEVEN SQUARE MILES WE AS THE
CITY GOVERNMENT ARE CHARGED WITH NOT JUST MAINTAINING THE
PUBLIC RIGHT OF WAY BUT MAKING SURE THAT IT IS SAFE FOR
EVERYONE BUT THAT IT IS ALSO, YOU KNOW, AVAILABLE FOR
EVERYONE. AND I THINK THAT THIS LEGISLATION DOES THE SAME. THIS IS A VERY COMPLICATED
ISSUE AND I WANT TO SAY THAT THE FOLKS WHO ARE LIVING
IN VEHICLES IN MY DISTRICT ARE NOT LIVING IN SAY FOR INSTANCE,
WHAT OR THE AREAS THAT ARE VERY WEALTHY THEY ARE LIVING
IN AREAS WHERE WORKING CLASS FOLKS LIVE IN RENT CONTROL
DEPARTMENTS AND THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF COMPLEX WHERE THE HOUSE RESIDENTS WHICH PUT PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN VEHICLES AT
RISK. WE HAVE HAD HARASSMENT, WE HAVE
HAD BROKEN WINDOWS. WE HAVE HAD PEOPLE WHO CALL LAW
ENFORCEMENT, FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THEY ARE BASICALLY SETTING TARGETS ON
OUR STREETS IN THE CITY AS WEALTHY AS OURS.
I THINK IT'S ON US TO BUILD THE SYSTEM, TO SUPPORT PEOPLE TO
SUCCESS AND NOT PRETEND THAT BY LEAVING THEM TO BE ON THE
STREETS WE ARE DOING THE PROGRESSIVE THING.
SO WITH THAT I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU SUPERVISOR CHAN THANK YOU PRESENT AMENDMENT THIS
LEGISLATION TO LIMIT LARGE VEHICLES PARKING TO TWO OUR
CITY Y HAS CREATED A LOT OF CONCERN FOR PEOPLE LIVING RVS
AND THOSE WHO SUPPORT THEM AND CARE FOR THEM AND IT
CREATES A LOT OF CONCERN FOR ME AS WELL.
>> HOWEVER, MAYOR DANIEL MURRAY'S TEAM AND REALLY
ESPECIALLY YOU KNOW, THANKS TO SUPERVISOR MELGAR REALLY HAVE
TOGETHER DEMONSTRATED IN GOOD FAITH A THOUGHTFUL APPROACH,
COMPASSIONATE SOLUTIONS AND WILLINGNESS TO TAKE FEEDBACK TO PROVIDE EXEMPTIONS TO THESE PARKING LIMITS AS A
RESULT WE WILL NOT ONLY SEE ENFORCEMENTS TO KEEP OUR PUBLIC SPACES CLEAN AND SAFE FOR EVERYONE BUT ALSO EARNEST
EFFORTS TO HOUSE PEOPLE LIVING IN RVS IN THE COMING MONTHS.
BUT THESE GUARANTEES DO NOT MEAN THAT WE SHOULD SIMPLY TRUST THE PROCESS. AS POLICYMAKERS WE MUST
CONTINUE TO HOST CITY DEPARTMENTS ACCOUNTABLE FOR AN
ONGOING COMPASSIONATE APPROACH. RESULTS DRIVEN SOLUTIONS AND A
COMMITMENT TO HEARING FEEDBACK AND MAKING IMPROVEMENTS.
SO I WILL BE REQUESTING REGULAR REPORTS TO IDENTIFY GAPS
IN FUNDING AND RESOURCES THAT MAY REQUIRE FURTHER POLICY
CHANGE. WHAT I DO KNOW THOUGH IS THIS
THAT IT IS NOT ACCEPTABLE FOR OUR CITY TO SIT ON THE DOLLARS
FROM OUR CITY, OUR HOME TO SIMPLY ACCRUE INTEREST WHEN THERE IS SO MUCH NEED. SO INSTEAD WE MUST SPEND ON
HOUSING SOLUTIONS FOR HOUSING SAN FRANCISCANS INCLUDING THOSE
LIVING IN RVS. SAN FRANCISCO VOTERS WANT US TO
DELIVER A SOLUTION WITH PUBLIC DOLLARS AND OUR CITY'S MOST
VULNERABLE CANNOT WAIT FOR THE PERFECT POLICY. THEY NEED A HOUSING RELIEF DOLLARS NOW.
AND SO FOR THAT REASON I WILL BE IN SUPPORTING THIS
LEGISLATION TODAY. AGAIN, I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING
FOLLOW UPS FOLLOW THROUGH. HOUSING PEOPLE AND THAT WE
CONTINUE TO CREATE EXEMPTIONS THROUGH THE REFUGE PERMITS
PROGRAM TOO AND ALSO AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TAKING OUR
AMENDMENTS FOR THE SHORT TERM RESIDENTIAL PARKING PERMITS AS
WELL SO THAT AGAIN PEOPLE WHO MAY NOT DEEM QUALIFY
IMMEDIATELY FOR THE REFUGE REFUGE PERMIT PROGRAM STILL
ACTUALLY HAVE TIME TO SORT THEMSELVES AND NOT BE DISPLACED
WITH THIS PARKING RESTRICTION. AND I THINK THAT THERE IS
ALWAYS A BALANCE APPROACH TO FIGURE OUT WAYS TO REALLY HOUSE
PEOPLE AND BE COMPASSIONATE AND AT THE SAME TIME HOW DO WE
KEEP SOME OF THE PUBLIC SPACES. AS INDICATED BY SUPERVISOR MAL
GAR SAFE AND WITHOUT HAZARDS AND AT THIS TIME IN SAN
FRANCISCO IT IS CHALLENGING TO DO SO.
WE ARE LIMITED WITH SPACES AND AVAILABILITY THAT CAN BE MADE SAFE FOR THOSE PURPOSES. THANK YOU.
>> SUPERVISOR WALTON THANK YOU, PRESIDENT MELAMED.
I THINK FOR ME WHEN I FIRST HEARD ABOUT THIS LEGISLATION I
WAS LIKE WOW. >> THE ADMINISTRATION FOUND
1444 HOMES FOR PEOPLE LIVING IN VEHICLES WHICH WAS THE 2024
POINT IN TIME COUNT EVEN THE 2025 EXACT COUNT WHICH IS NOT
AN OFFICIAL PRETTY STATED THAT THERE WERE 437 PEOPLE LIVING
IN LARGE VEHICLES. >> WHICH IS NOT THE TOTAL
AMOUNT OF FOLKS LIVING IN VEHICLES.
THAT'S GREAT. BUT THIS IS NOT THE CASE. THIS PROPOSAL IS OFFERING HOUSING TO PEOPLE LIVING IN RVS
HOUSING THAT WE DO NOT HAVE, HOUSING THAT WE NEVER HAD.
THIS ALSO MEANS THAT PEOPLE LIVING ON THE STREET ARE GOING
TO BE SKIPPED OVER WHILE FOLKS LIVING IN VEHICLES ARE
PRIORITIZED. >> I KNOW THAT A NEGATIVE TIMES
A NEGATIVE IS A POSITIVE BUT A NEGATIVE PLUS A POSITIVE IS
NEGATIVE. IF THE NEGATIVE NUMBER IS
LARGER. >> SO SIMPLE MATHEMATICS TELLS
ME THAT MORE RV THAN SHELTER BEDS EQUALS AN INEFFECTIVE
AND IMPOSSIBLE PLAN. THIS IS OPERATIONALLY
IMPOSSIBLE TO IMPLEMENT. >> WE HAVE SUDDENLY FOUND HOMES
AND BEDS FOR ALL PEOPLE LIVING IN VEHICLES THEN WE WOULDN'T EVEN BE DISCUSSING THIS IMPOSSIBLE PLAN WHICH IN MY
OPINION IS A PLAN TO FAIL. >> THE LEGISLATION ITSELF
STATES ON PAGE TWO LINES 11 THROUGH 16 ON APRIL 11TH, 2025
THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELESSNESS AND SUPPORTIVE HOUSING CLOSED
THE BABY VEHICLE CAREER CENTER PROGRAM AT CAMP POINT STATE
RECREATION AREA. >> THE PROGRAM WHICH
ACCOMMODATED 35 LARGE VEHICLES AT AN ANNUAL OPERATING COST OF
2.9 MILLION DID NOT ACHIEVE THE INTENDED OUTCOME.
AIMS OF TRANSITIONING PARTICIPANTS TO STABLE HOUSING
OR SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVING STREET CONDITIONS IN THE SURROUNDING AREA. >> THAT PART I DISAGREE WITH
BUT THE LEGISLATION ITSELF STATES THAT THERE WAS A FAILURE
TO TRANSFER FOLKS FROM VEHICLES INTO HOMES.
NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN THOSE HOMES ARE AVAILABLE.
I THINK THAT THERE'S A NEED TO DO SOMETHING BUT IT'S NOT THIS
WHERE ARE WE GOING TO STORE THESE VEHICLES?
HOW DO WE DETERMINE THE VALUE? TOO MANY QUESTIONS TO BE
ANSWERED WITH THIS LEGISLATION. >> I DON'T BELIEVE THIS PLAN
WILL DO ANYTHING BUT CRIMINALIZE PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE STABLE BRICK AND MORTAR HOMES.
>> THIS WILL BE AN ATTACK ON PEOPLE TRYING TO HAVE A SHELTER
IN THIS EXPENSIVE CITY AND THEY WILL LOSE THEIR ONLY HOMES.
A HOME IS A PLACE WHERE ONE LIVES PERMANENTLY ESPECIALLY AS
A MEMBER OF A FAMILY OR HOUSEHOLD.
>> TO SAY THAT SOMEONE LIVING IN A VEHICLE DOES NOT HAVE A
HOME IS MALICIOUS WHEN THEY HAVE NO OTHER FORM OF SHELTER.
>> THIS LEGISLATION IS ALLUDING TO SUPPORTING BRICK AND MORTAR
AS THE ONLY POSSIBLE HOME AND THE MOST EXPENSIVE CITY ON
THE PLANET. >> I CAN NOT CONDONE MASSIVE
ACTIONS TO THE STREETS FOR PEOPLE TRYING TO LIVE IN THEIR HOMES MOBILE OR NOT ESPECIALLY AT A TIME WHEN THERE IS AN
ATTACK ON IMMIGRANTS, PEOPLE OF COLOR, OUR LGBTQ COMMUNITY
AND BASICALLY ANYONE THAT IS NOT IN THE 1%.
>> I TRULY THINK THAT THIS PLAN IS UNOBTAINABLE AND SOMETHING
THAT WE SHOULDN'T BE CONSIDERING.
>> AT THIS BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. AND I KNOW THAT MANY PEOPLE MAY DISAGREE WITH ME BUT THIS IS
VERY PROBLEMATIC FOR ME TO SIT HERE AND VOTE ON SOMETHING THAT
I KNOW IS GOING TO FAIL. >> THANKS TO ROSE WALTON.

INTRODUCING A RESOLUTION A RESOLUTION AFFIRMING DUE PROCESS RIGHT AND COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIP FOR PUBLIC SAFETY
AND URGING TRAINING AND PROTOCOLS FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT. GIVEN RECENT FEDERAL
IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS AND INCREASED LAW ENFORCEMENT
IMPERSONATIONS, SAN FRANCISCO HAS SEEN A GREAT REDUCTION
IN CRIME OVER THE PAST YEARS. >> A LOT OF THAT HAS BEEN
ACHIEVED THROUGH COMMUNITY BUILDING BETWEEN LAW
ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AND COMMUNITY. THIS EFFORTS HAVE BEEN SUPPORTED THROUGH THE
STRENGTHENING OF OVERSIGHT BODIES ACCOUNTABILITY
AND TRANSPARENCY. >> LAST TUESDAY ROUGHLY TEN ICE
AGENTS CLASH WITH PROTESTERS OUTSIDE OF A COURTHOUSE AT 100
MONTGOMERY STREET. >> MANY OF THESE AGENTS COVER
THEIR FACES IN OTHER INCIDENTS ,ALLEGED ICE AGENTS HAVE
APPROACHED CITIZENS IN UNMARKED VEHICLES.
ICE OPERATION HAVE ESCALATED OVER THE PAST MONTHS AND WILL
LIKELY TO CONTINUE TO ESCALATE UNDER THIS FEDERAL
ADMINISTRATION. >> IN ADDITION TO THE
ESCALATION OF DETENTIONS AND DEPORTATION IN THE UNITED STATE, THERE HAS BEEN A MASSIVE SPIKE IN LAW ENFORCEMENT
IMPERSONATIONS IN WHICH NONFEDERAL AGENTS PRETEND TO BE
ICE OPERATIVE TO SPREAD FEARS, HATE AND CHAOS.
>> THIS INSTANCE ERODE ANY PUBLIC TRUST THAT WAS BEING
BUILT BETWEEN COMMUNITIES, ESPECIALLY COMMUNITIES OF COLOR
AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. WE NEED HELP POLICY. WE NEED OUR POLICE DEPARTMENT
AND SHERIFF'S OFFICE TO PRIORITIZE TAKING THE STEPS
NECESSARY TO PRESERVE PUBLIC TRUST DURING THIS TIME.

SUPERVISOR IF THEY ARE NOT CLEARLY IF THEY ARE NOT CLEARLY
IDENTIFIED AND CAPTURED. >> VERIFICATION ON BODY WORN
CAMERAS TO ENSURE TRANSPARENCY POLICY IMPLEMENTATION LIKE THIS
ARE THE MODEST BUT IMPORTANT STEP IN SAFEGUARDING PUBLIC
TRUST UPHOLDING PUBLIC SAFETY FOR ALL OF OUR CITY'S RESIDENTS
AND STANDING UP FOR THE DUAL PROCESS RIGHT THAT ARE AFFORDED
TO EVERYONE. >> AND I WANT TO THANK MY
COLLEAGUES SUPERVISOR FIELDER MAMU WALTON AND MALKA FOR THEIR
EARLY CO-SPONSORSHIP. >> MENDOZA AND I ALSO HAVE A
GOOD NEIGHBORHOOD POLICY THAT I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE
AND TODAY I DRAFTING THE REQUEST FROM THE REQUEST.
>> I AM INTRODUCING A DRAFT REQUEST FROM THE CITY
ATTORNEY'S OFFICE EVERY DAY I RECEIVE FEEDBACK FROM
CONSTITUENTS WHO ARE CONCERNED ABOUT POSSIBLE IMPACT ON THEIR
NEIGHBORHOODS IF COVERED A FACILITY FOR HOMELESSNESS OR
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES ARE BUILT NEARBY.
THE REALITY IS THAT THESE ARE LIFE SAVING AND STABILIZING
SERVICES THAT OUR CITY DESPERATELY NEEDS. >> BUT IT IS ALSO TRUE THAT THE CITY HASN'T ALWAYS UPHELD ITS
SIDE OF THE BARGAIN TO ENSURE THAT THIS FACILITY IS OUR GOOD
NEIGHBORS. I HAVE ASKED THE CITY ATTORNEY'S OFFICE TO WORK WITH MY TEAM TO DRAFT LEGISLATION
THAT WOULD FORMALLY CODIFY THE GOOD NEIGHBORHOOD POLICY FOR
COVER FACILITIES AND MANDATE COMMUNITIES SERVICES PLANS WITH
COMMITMENTS FOR RESPONSIVE DEPARTMENTS.
>> IT DOESN'T APPEAR THAT GOOD NEIGHBORHOOD OR GOOD NEIGHBOR
POLICY HAVE THEIR THERE DON'T APPEAR TO BE STRONG
ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES, PERFORMANCE METRICS OR PUBLIC
PLANS THAT CONSTITUENTS CAN ACCESS TO BE INFORMED OF WHAT
IS REALISTICALLY EXPECTED WHEN A NEW FACILITY IS PROPOSED
IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS. >> OUR DEPARTMENTS WORK
IN SILOS AND OUR NONPROFIT PARTNERS OPERATING TWO SITES
ARE WOEFULLY UNDERFUNDED BUT ASKED TO DO MORE WORK ON TOP OF
THE CARE THAT THEY PROVIDE TO SOME OF OUR CITY'S MOST VULNERABLE AND ACUTE. THIS HAS ERODED PUBLIC TRUST
AND AND IT'S ALSO PIVOT ESSENTIAL SERVICES AGAINST NEIGHBORHOODS IN AN ATTEMPT TO FORCE SOME MORE WORKING
COLLABORATION AND SHARE OWNERSHIP OF CITY OWNED
FACILITIES. THE COMMUNITY SERVICES PLAN
WILL REQUIRE THAT DEPARTMENTS PROVIDE INFORMATION ON WHAT
NEIGHBORS CAN EXPECT FROM THEIR INVOLVEMENT. I'M EXCITED TO WORK ON THIS LEGISLATION AND WILL HOPEFULLY
EARN YOUR SUPPORT ONCE DRAFTED. >> THANK YOU.
THANK YOU. SUPERVISOR CHEN SUPERVISOR
DORSEY SUBMIT. THANK YOU SUPERVISOR
AND ENGARDIO COLLEAGUES TODAY I'M INTRODUCING A RESOLUTION
REAFFIRMING THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS SUPPORT FOR THE SAN
FRANCISCO SCHOOL DISTRICT'S SHARED SCHOOLYARDS PROGRAM
AND URGES THE SCHOOL DISTRICT TO EXPLORE PARTNERSHIPS THAT EXPAND PUBLIC ACCESS TO NEIGHBORHOOD SCHOOLYARDS.
OUR SCHOOLYARDS HAVE INCREASED ACCESS TO REACT RECREATIONAL
OPEN SPACE IN COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE CITY.
FAMILIES LOVE BEING ABLE TO USE THEIR LOCAL SCHOOLYARD FOR
RECREATION WHEN SCHOOL IS NOT IN SESSION. THIS USE IS WORTH PRESERVING AND WE SHOULD PROMOTE SITE
AWARENESS AND ENCOURAGE SHARED ACCOUNTABILITY AND INVESTMENT IN OUR SCHOOL FACILITIES. THE PROGRAM PLANNED TO INCLUDE
61 SCHOOLYARDS SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE CITY.
UNFORTUNATELY THE SCHOOL DISTRICT SHUTTERED THIS SHARED SCHOOLYARD PROGRAM ON JULY 1ST. UNLOCKING OUR SCHOOLYARDS ON
WEEKENDS IS ONE OF THE SIMPLEST AND MOST COST EFFECTIVE WAYS TO
INCREASE ACCESS TO OPEN SPACE FOR SAN FRANCISCO FAMILIES
LEAVING THEM LOCKED IN INACCESSIBLE WOULD BE A
DISSERVICE TO PARENTS AND FAMILIES. THE SHARED SCHOOLYARDS PROGRAM HAS IMPROVED QUALITY OF LIFE
IN NEIGHBORHOODS ACROSS EVERY DISTRICT AND IT'S LOSS WILL BE
FELT CITYWIDE. SO IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE SUPPORT THE SCHOOL DISTRICT AND FINDING A SUSTAINABLE PATH
FORWARD WITH A SHARED SCHOOLYARD PROGRAM AND ENSURE
THAT SAN FRANCISCO'S NEXT GENERATION OF CHILDREN, YOUTH AND FAMILIES CONTINUE TO BENEFIT FROM THESE ESSENTIAL
RECREATIONAL SPACES AND THE REST I SUBMIT.
>> THANK YOU. SUPERVISOR AND ENGARDIO SUPERVISOR FIELDER THANK YOU, MADAM CLERK COLLEAGUES TODAY I
HAVE ONE INTRODUCTION AND ONE IN MEMORIAM FOR THE
INTRODUCTION. LAST WEEK AT A CASTRO TOWN HALL
AS A PITY LEADERSHIP MADE DEEPLY TROUBLING REMARKS SUGGESTING THAT LOCAL POLICE SHOULD BE PREPARED TO PROTECT
FEDERAL ICE AGENTS FROM UNARMED PROTESTERS AND EQUATING THEM TO
CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL NEEDING BACKUP.
I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT THESE KIND OF EQUIVALENCIES ARE BOTH
INVALID AND DANGEROUS. IT'S BAFFLING TO ME THAT AS IF
PD LEADERSHIP WOULD EQUATE UNARMED PROTESTERS WITH TRUMP'S
ARMED ICE AGENTS, ICE AGENTS CAN PROTECT THEMSELVES WITH
THEIR PEPPER SPRAY, THEIR GUNS, THEIR VEHICLES AND THEIR ARMOR
AS THEY DID SO READILY ON PROTESTERS LAST TUESDAY.
ICE IS NOT A LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY UPHOLDING PUBLIC SAFETY.
>> IT IS A FASCIST OPERATION THAT IS VIOLATING COURT ORDERS
AND THE RULE OF LAW TO STOKE FEAR.
>> AND SO CHAOS. >> I AM GENERAL QUESTIONS ON
THE COSTS OF DEPLOYING US OF PD OFFICERS AND SHERIFFS TO
PROTEST SURVEILLANCE OF DEMONSTRATORS PROTOCOLS FOR
PROTECTING PROTESTERS DURING INTERACTIONS WITH ICE AND THE STEPS IF ANY THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT TAKES TO VERIFY THE
IDENTITY OF FEDERAL AGENTS TO THWART IMPERSONATORS IN A CITY
WITH REAL PUBLIC SAFETY NEEDS LIKE THE CHALLENGING CONDITIONS
IN MY DISTRICT ON 16TH STREET. >> WE NEED OFFICERS ON FOOT
PATROLS NOT ACTING AS BODYGUARDS FOR ICE.
AND LASTLY, JUST YESTERDAY A STANDARD ARTICLE REPORTED THAT AS LIVE PD SHARED AUTOMATIC LICENSE PLATE READER DATA WITH
FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES IN VIOLATION OF CALIFORNIA STATE LAW. >> FOR ALL THESE REASONS I'VE
SUBMITTED A FORMAL LETTER OF INQUIRY TO THE POLICE
DEPARTMENT THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT AND THE
COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE ASKING FOR A FULL ACCOUNT OF DECISION
MAKING RELATED TO THESE DATA SHARING PRACTICES. THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS UNLEASHED BILLIONS OF DOLLARS
IN FUNDING TO EXPAND ICE'S DETENTION AND ENFORCEMENT
APPARATUS AND SO WE MUST ASK WILL SAN FRANCISCO LAW
ENFORCEMENT BE A PARTICIPANT IN THAT OR WILL IT DEFEND OUR
PEOPLE BECAUSE OF THE URGENCY OF ESCALATING ACTIONS BY THE
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION? I EXPECT FULL RESPONSES FROM
S.F. PD, THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT AND THE COMPTROLLER
IN 13 DAYS BY JULY 28TH. >> OUR RESIDENTS DESERVE TRANSPOWER AGENCY ACCOUNTABILITY AND A POLICE
DEPARTMENT THAT DEFENDS OUR SANCTUARY CITY LAWS NOT ONE
THAT COLLABORATES WITH AGENCIES INTENT ON CAUSING FEAR
AND CHAOS IN OUR COMMUNITIES. FINALLY I HAVE AN IN MEMORIAM.
>> IS WITH A HEAVY HEART THAT I SHARE THIS IN MEMORIAM FOR
THREE BELOVED BROTHERS HASSOCKS MANASSAS RAMOS WHO'S 18 JONI
ERNST OR RAMOS 22 AND JOEL JEREMIAH'S MELENDEZ, 28, WHO
PERISHED IN THE RECENT EXPLOSION AT A FIREWORKS
WAREHOUSE IN YOLO COUNTY ON JULY 1ST.
>> AS SUSAN JONI WERE ALUMNI OF ONE OF EASTERN HORSEMEN
IN DISTRICT NINE TO DO THIS IN MEMORIAM JUSTICE I'M GOING
TO SHARE THE WORDS OF THREE ADULTS WHO KNEW AND LOVED THE
BOYS IN DIFFERENT WAYS FROM ONE OF US TO HORACE MANN, SOCIAL
WORKER NICK CHANDLER QUOTE QUOTE IN HAZARDS RAMOS IN THEIR
SHORT TIME AT BHM COMPRISED THE CENTER OF A BEAUTIFUL COMMUNITY
THAT SPANNED FROM THE MISSION DISTRICT TO RICHMOND, SAN PABLO
AND UP TO THE SACRAMENTO VALLEY. WHILE UNIQUE IN SO MANY WAYS, THESE BROTHERS SHARED A COMMON
GIFT THEY EACH MOVED THROUGH THE WORLD WITH A SUBTLE
AND KNOWING SMILE. >> THEIR EYES AND DEMEANOR PUT
ONE AT EASE, LIFTED SPIRITS AND REMINDED PEOPLE AROUND THEM
OF THE JOY, HUMOR AND BEAUTY IN EVERY MOMENT.
THEY WERE TRUSTED AND DEPENDABLE ANCHORS TO
COUNTLESS FRIENDS AND FAMILY MEMBERS. THERE WERE LOYAL BEYOND QUESTION RADICALLY HONEST
AND COMMITTED TO UPHOLDING THE VALUES OF THEIR FAMILY
AND COMMUNITY AT ALL COSTS. >> THE RIPPLE EFFECT OF THEIR
TRAGIC DEATH IS VAST AND ILLUMINATES THE IMPACT THEY
HAD ON THE WORLD. THEIR PREMATURE PASSING LEAVES
A HOLE IN OUR HEARTS AND COMMUNITY DEPRIVING US OF
THE FRUITS OF THEIR JOURNEY AND REMINDING US ALL OF HOW
RARE AND PRICELESS IT IS TO HAVE PEOPLE LIKE YONI AND HIS
LEWIS RAMOS IN YOUR CORNER AND IN YOUR HEART.
>> FROM HSUS AND JOHNNY'S TEACHER AND MENTOR JEFF SENO
QUOTE I HAVE KNOWN THE RAMOS FAMILY FOR OVER TEN YEARS
AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I HAVE LEARNED FROM THE BROTHERS
YONI AND HIS SERVICE IS THAT THE BEST PEOPLE AREN'T NECESSARILY THE BEST STUDENTS. YONI AND HIS SONS WERE THE BEST
PEOPLE. THEY ROUTINELY GAVE THEIR
TEACHERS A RUN FOR THEIR MONEY AND EACH IN THEIR OWN WAY.
YONI CHALLENGED AUTHORITY AND OFTEN QUESTIONED WHAT WAS
BEING TAUGHT THAT DAY QUOTE IS THIS REALLY NECESSARY?
>> HE'D ASK POLITELY RAISING HIS HAND.
HIS INQUIRIES OFTEN PROMPTED VALID CLASS WIDE DISCUSSIONS
AND THE TEACHER WHO PAID ATTENTION TO HIS COMMENTS
AND MODIFY THE LESSON OF THE DAY ON THE DAILY ON THE SPOT
BECAME IN THE END A BETTER TEACHER.
YONI WAS A LUXURY CAR FROM ANOTHER TIME CALMLY GLIDING
AROUND THE HILLY CURVES OF MIDDLE SCHOOL SPREADING JOY,
GOODWILL AND GENEROSITY IN HIS WAKE.
WHEN THAT MOVIE EVERYTHING EVERYWHERE ALL AT ONCE CAME OUT A FEW YEARS AGO I WAS CERTAIN IT HAD TO BE THE LIFE STORY OF
HAZARDOUS RAMOS PERRY AND PATHETIC TO A DEGREE THAT
WAS HARDLY MORTAL. THIS BOY WAS EVERYWHERE ALL THE
TIME FROM THE ROOF OF THE BREEZEWAY TO THE DEPTHS OF THE
DUNGEON BELOW THE SCHOOL. >> NO STONE WAS LEFT UNTURNED
BY THIS DUDE. WHEREAS YONI CHALLENGED AUTHORITY HAS THUS CHALLENGED LIFE ITSELF WITH AN
INTELLIGENCE PRESENCE THAT BELIE HIS LIMITED YEARS.
I'M CONFIDENT THAT HIS SERVICE HAS ALREADY SQUEEZE IN AT LEAST
6 OR 7 IMPORTANT AND NOTEWORTHY LIFETIMES DURING HIS SHORT TIME
HERE. >> AND FINALLY FROM HIS SOUZA'S HIGH SCHOOL PRINCIPAL ADVISOR IN A CLASS AFTER HIS NEWS RAMOS
IS A VALUED MEMBER OF THE INDEPENDENCE HIGH SCHOOL
COMMUNITY IS A PROUD GRADUATE OF THE CLASS OF 2025 WHO EARNED
HIS DIPLOMA ON JUNE 4TH. HE'S KNOWN BEST FOR HIS BRIGHT
SMILE AND HIS ARTISTIC ABILITIES AS A MURALIST AS
SOUZA'S REMEMBERED FONDLY BY HIS TEACHERS AND HIS CLOSE
GROUP OF FRIENDS. HE WAS ALWAYS SUPPORTED BY HIS
LOVING FAMILY AND WE ARE HOLDING THEM CLOSELY IN OUR
THOUGHTS UNQUOTE. >> THEIR OLDER BROTHER JOEL WAS
A MENTOR TO HIS YOUNGER BROTHERS.
THEY WORKED TOGETHER AT THE WAREHOUSE AND HAD BIG PLANS FOR
THEIR FUTURES. I WANT TO OFFER MY DEEPEST
CONDOLENCES TO THE RAMOS FAMILY AND FRIENDS THE ENTIRE ONE OF
MR. HORSMAN COMMUNITY AND TO THEIR SIBLINGS JANELLA
AND ERNEST THOUGH JOEL'S MOTHER AND MOST OF ALL TO THEIR
PARENTS MARISOL AT INDIANA AND JOHNNY RAMOS SENIOR.
YOUR SONS HAD A LASTING IMPACT ON SO MANY.
AND WHILE OUR HEARTS ARE BROKEN, THEIR MEMORY LIVES ON
IN OUR COMMUNITY. REST IN PEACE AND POWER.
HIS SONS YONI AND JOEL. >> THANK YOU.

>> COLLEAGUES TODAY I'M INTRODUCING A LETTER OF INQUIRY
TO THE SAN FRANCISCO POLICE DEPARTMENT INTERIM CHIEF YAP
REGARDING CAPTAIN TURNOVER WITHIN AS A PD MY OFFICE HAS
HEARD CONSISTENTLY FROM RESIDENTS AND NEIGHBORHOOD LEADERS THE CRITICAL ROLE STATION CAPTAINS PLAY IN LOCAL
PUBLIC SAFETY NOT ONLY THROUGH DELIVERING PUBLIC SAFETY
AND ENFORCEMENT FOR OUR COMMUNITIES BUT THROUGH
COMMUNITY RELATIONSHIP BUILDING AND LONG TERM PROBLEM SOLVING
FOR SOME OF OUR TOUGHEST CHALLENGES. >> HOWEVER FREQUENT OR UNEXPECTED CAPTAIN
REASSIGNMENTS CAN UNDERMINE THAT TRUST STALL PROGRESS ON
ONGOING ISSUES AND CREATE UNCERTAINTY FOR THE COMMUNITIES
WE SERVE IN DISTRICT FIVE ALONE WE'VE LOST FIVE DIFFERENT
POLICE CAPTAINS OVER THREE POLICE DISTRICTS IN JUST THE
PAST SIX MONTHS. I RECOGNIZE THAT MANY OF YOU
HERE ALSO SHARE THE SAME CONCERNS I'VE HAD THE FELT THE
UNCERTAINTY OF CHANGES IN PUBLIC SAFETY LEADERSHIP.
>> THAT'S WHY WE'RE ASKING THE POLICE DEPARTMENT TO SHARE DATA
FROM THE PAST FIVE YEARS ON HOW OFTEN CAPTAINS HAVE BEEN
REASSIGNED OR REPLACED AND FOR WHAT REASONS WHETHER DUE TO
PROMOTION, REASSIGNMENT OR RETIREMENT. >> WE'RE ALSO ASKING WHETHER THE DEPARTMENT TRACKS THESE
TRANSITIONS IN A CENTRALIZED WAY AND WHETHER ANY STRATEGIES
EXIST OR COULD BE DEVELOPED TO SUPPORT LONGER CAPTAIN TENURES
AT INDIVIDUAL STATIONS. >> THIS ISN'T JUST A MATTER OF
STAFFING IT'S ABOUT STABILITY, ACCOUNTABILITY AND BUILDING
STRONG LASTING PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN STATION LEADERSHIP
AND THE COMMUNITIES THAT THEY SERVE. >> I LOOK FORWARD TO THE DEPARTMENT'S RESPONSE AND TO
CONTINUING THIS CONVERSATION ON HOW WE CAN IMPROVE LEADERSHIP
CONTINUITY AND NEIGHBORHOOD SAFETY OUTCOMES ACROSS OUR
CITY. AND I WANT TO THANK SUPERVISORS WALTON CHERYL SAUTER AND FIELDER FOR THEIR
CO-SPONSORSHIP FOR THIS LETTER OF INQUIRY AS WELL.
>> THE LAST I SUBMIT THANK YOU SUPERVISOR MIKE WOOD SUPERVISOR
MENDELSOHN THANK YOU MADAM CLERK COLLEAGUES TODAY I AM INTRODUCING A RESOLUTION RECOGNIZING THE 35TH
ANNIVERSARY OF THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT
AND CELEBRATING THE WORK OF DISABILITY RIGHTS LEADERS
IN SAN FRANCISCO. >> THE ADA WAS SIGNED INTO LAW
ON JULY 26TH, 1990. EVERY JULY WE CELEBRATE
DISABILITY PRIDE MONTH TO HONOR THE PASSAGE OF THIS LAW AND THE HISTORY ACHIEVEMENTS, EXPERIENCES, EXPERIENCES
AND STRUGGLES OF THE DISABILITY COMMUNITY.
SAN FRANCISCO EARNED ITS PLACE IN THE HISTORY OF THE STRUGGLE FOR DISABILITY RIGHTS IN 1977. JUST A FEW BLOCKS AWAY IN U.N.
PLAZA, HUNDREDS OF ACTIVISTS FROM GROUPS INCLUDING THE BLACK
PANTHER PARTY GLIDE MEMORIAL CHURCH, GAY MEN'S BUTTERFLY
BRIGADE DE LANCEY STREET, THE UNITED FARMWORKERS, THE GRAY
PANTHERS AND THE SALVATION ARMY STAGED THE HISTORIC 504 SIT
IN AT THE SAN FRANCISCO HEALTH, EDUCATION AND WELFARE FEDERAL
BUILDING. THE COALITION CALLED FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PARTICULARLY HEALTH, EDUCATION AND WELFARE
SECRETARY JOSEPH CALIFANO JR. TO IMPLEMENT SECTION FIVE OF
FOUR OF THE REHABILITATION ACT OF 1973. A PREDECESSOR TO THE ADA THAT PROHIBITED DISCRIMINATION
AGAINST PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES IN PROGRAMS
AND ACTIVITIES RECEIVING FEDERAL FUNDING. THAT 28 DAY SIT IN WAS THE LONGEST TAKEOVER OF A FEDERAL
BUILDING IN AMERICAN HISTORY. THE COALITION WON CONVINCING
SECRETARY CALIFANO TO SIGN REGULATIONS TO ENFORCE SECTION
504. THIS MOMENT BROUGHT NATIONAL
ATTENTION TO THE NEEDS OF THE DISABILITY COMMUNITY AND HELPED SECURE AND HELPED LEAD TO THE PASSAGE OF THE ADA.
IT'S WORTH NOTING THAT THE AMERICAN DISABILITY RIGHTS MOVEMENT SIMPLY WOULD NOT BE WHERE IT IS TODAY WITHOUT THE
CONTRIBUTIONS OF SAN FRANCISCO ADVOCATES PARTICULARLY WOMEN
INCLUDING JUDI HUMAN WHO LED THE FIGHT BEFORE CITY
AND FOUNDED KEY ORGANIZATIONS LIKE DISABLED IN ACTION IN THE WORLD AND STOOD ON DISABILITY. PATTY BYRNE WHO CO-FOUNDED
AND LED SENDS INVALID AND DEBBIE KAPLAN, ALICE WONG
AND SASHA BITTNER WHO WERE HONORED HERE EARLIER TODAY.
>> SAN FRANCISCO HAS DEMONSTRATED ITS COMMITMENT TO
SUPPORTING PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES THROUGH THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE MAYOR'S OFFICE ON DISABILITY.
NOW THE OFFICE ON DISABILITY AND ACCESSIBILITY AND THE MAYOR'S DISABILITY COUNCIL PROVISION OF DIRECT SERVICES TO
THE DEPARTMENT OF DISABILITY AND AGING SERVICES AND THE
DISTRIBUTION OF GRANTS TO MAKE BUSINESSES ACCESSIBLE THROUGH THE OFFICE OF SMALL BUSINESS. LATER THIS WEEK I'LL BE JOINING
MEMBERS OF THE DISABILITY COMMUNITY AND CITY STAFF TO
CELEBRATE THE GRAND OPENING OF THE SAN FRANCISCO DISABILITY CULTURAL CENTER, THE NATION'S FIRST MUNICIPALLY FUNDED
DISABILITY CENTER AND A FIRST OF ITS KIND SPACE DEDICATED TO
HONORING THE ARTISTIC CULTURAL AND CIVIC CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE
DISABILITY COMMUNITY NONETHELESS AND NOTWITHSTANDING
THE IMPORTANT WORK THAT HAS BEEN DONE TO EXPAND SERVICES AND PROTECTIONS, MANY PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES STILL
EXPERIENCE DISCRIMINATION WHEN TRYING TO ACCESS HOUSING,
EMPLOYMENT, HEALTH CARE AND MANY OTHER ESSENTIAL AREAS
. THIS RESOLUTION RECOGNIZES THE HARD FOUGHT WINS AND REAFFIRMS SAN FRANCISCO'S COMMITMENT TO
INCREASING ACCESS. I WANT TO THANK THE DIRECTOR OF

GOOD FOOD PURCHASING STANDARDS PERMANENT FOR HOSPITALS
AND JAILS. THIS ORDINANCE WAS PREVIOUSLY
INTRODUCED BY SUPERVISORS FEUER AND MENDHAM IN AND PASSED BY
THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS IN 2020. BUT THE SUNSET DATE OF SEPTEMBER 2025 THE VERSION THAT
I'M INTRODUCING TODAY WILL REMOVE THE SUNSET DATE AND LOCK
IN STRONGER GOALS AROUND SUSTAINABILITY HEALTH, LABOR
PRACTICES AND LOCAL SOURCING OF FOOD. IT KEEPS SAN FRANCISCO COMMITTED TO USING ITS PUBLIC
DOLLARS TO SUPPORT ETHICAL FOOD SYSTEMS THAT BENEFIT PEOPLE.
WORKERS AND THE BROADER COMMUNITY.
>> FOR HOSPITALS THE ORDINANCE MOVES TO GO FOR SOURCING FROM
SMALL AND MEDIUM SIZED FARMS UP TO 15% AND REQUIRES THE
DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH TO PUBLICLY SHARE ANY VENDOR LABOR VIOLATION. IT ALSO CONTINUES EFFORTS TO
REDUCE THE CARBON FOOTPRINT OF FOOD PROCUREMENT, CUT DOWN ON
WASTE AND IMPROVE NUTRITION THROUGH HEALTHIER MENUS
AND SUSTAINABLE PURCHASING PRACTICES FOR JAILS
AND INCREASES LOCAL FOOD PURCHASING UP TO 40% DOUBLING
THE TARGET FOR PESTICIDE FREE FOODS AND REQUIRING THE
SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT TO PUBLICLY REPORT VENDOR LABOR
VIOLATIONS. THESE CHANGES WILL SUPPORT
BETTER HEALTH OUTCOMES FOR INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS WHILE
PUSHING THE CITY'S FOOD VENDORS TO MEET HIGHER STANDARDS.
>> BOTH THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT WILL BE REQUIRED TO REPORT TO THE BOARD EVERY TWO
YEARS ON THEIR PROGRESS. AT THE END OF THE DAY THIS IS
ABOUT USING THE CITY'S FOOD DOLLARS TO INVEST IN HEALTHIER
COMMUNITIES AND PROTECT OUR WORKERS WHILE MAKING SURE THE
FOOD SERVED IN OUR PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS REFLECTS OUR
VALUES. >> I WOULD LIKE TO THANK DEPUTY CITY ATTORNEYS VALERIE LOPEZ AND SAM PEARSON.

THERE WILL BE NO DISAPPOINTMENT FOR THE EXTRA WEST OF ENERGY
THAT YOU CREATED HERE BY BEATING YOUR ON THE BUSH AGAIN.
>> WELL, AS YOU SHOULD KNOW MOST OF YOU THAT YOU'VE BEEN
UNDER ARREST SINCE SEPTEMBER. SO NOW ALL THE EVIDENCE SHOWS
THAT THE ENTIRE POLITICAL SPECTRUM MOSTLY PERSONIFIED BY
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS PART AND PARCEL OF A BIT OF A
PEDOPHILE RING FROM WHICH YOU ARE NOT EXEMPT FOR THE VERY
FACT THAT THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE IN BETWEEN AN ACTING
PEDOPHILE AND SOMEONE NOT CALLING IMMORAL OUT.

THAT THE PALESTINIANS NEED TO HAVE THEIR CLEAN WATER, THEIR
FOOD, THEIR MEDICINE AND THERE'S NO PLACE TO GO TO
THE BATHROOM. >> THERE'S ALL KINDS OF DISEASES. THEY LIVE IN TENTS WHEN THEY
PALESTINIANS GO FOR THE FOOD THEY KILL THEM ANYWAYS WHEN ARE
WE GOING TO GET IT RIGHT? AND I WILL SAY ANOTHER TIME I DO GET PER MONTH TO ST JUDE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL AND WE ALL
BELONG ON THIS PLANET. WE'RE ALL HUMAN BEINGS AND I
HOPE ONE DAY WE CAN GET IT RIGHT. SO SHALOM SHALOM PEACE. THANK YOU.
I HOPE I LIVE HERE IN GOOD HEALTH. THANK YOU. >> THANK YOU, MR. RAHMAN FOR
YOUR COMMENTS. WELCOME TO OUR NEXT SPEAKER.
>> IS THAT YOU, MS.. BROWN?
OKAY. ALL RIGHT. WELCOME. ALL RIGHT.
I TRIED TO DO THIS YESTERDAY BUT I WAS TOLD BY LAND USE THAT
TODAY WAS THE APPROPRIATE DAY INTO THE MICROPHONE PLEASE. TODAY WAS THE APPROPRIATE DAY TO PRESENT OUR VIEWS FROM NORTH
BEACH ON UP ZONING. MY NAME IS MARK BRUNO.
I WORK WITH ENFORCING VINCENT DE PAUL SOCIETY IN NORTH BEACH.
I'LL START NOW IN THE FIRST SENTENCE OF THE PRESS RELEASE
ON FAMILY ZONING THE MAYOR MENTIONS AFFORDABILITY. THE REPORT PRESENTED BY PLANNING ON JUNE 26TH JUST TWO
DAYS LATER MENTIONS AFFORDABILITY 20 TIMES EVERY
FORUM PRESENTED BY THE CITY AND UP SOMETHING THAT I'VE BEEN ABLE TO ATTEND THREE OF THEM HAS INCLUDED A DISCUSSION OF
AFFORDABILITY. IT SEEMS THAT IT'S AN
OVERARCHING BENEFIT OFFERED BY THOSE WHO FAVOR UP ZONING.
WHY THEN DOES THE PLANNING MAP ATTACHED TO THE ORDINANCES
FAVORING UP ZONING INCLUDE BUILDINGS WITH AFFORDABLE
UNITS? WHY ARE WE INVITING THOSE UNITS TO BE DEMOLISHED PUTTING AN UP ZONING TARGET ON THE BACKS OF
THOSE BUILDINGS AND THOSE RESIDENTS WHILE AT THE SAME TIME PROMISING MORE AFFORDABILITY?
WE HAD ST VINCENT DE PAUL SOCIETY IN NORTH BEACH AS OF
2028 WE'LL HAVE WORK WITH THE POOR AND THOSE LIVING IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR 100 YEARS JUST THREE YEARS FROM
NOW. AND WE FIND THIS APPROACH
NONSENSICAL AT BEST AND COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY TO
MEET STATE HOUSING MANDATES. THE CITY HAS ADEQUATE PARCELS
WHOSE OWNERS ARE LIKELY TO BE ENTICED BY UP ZONING WITHOUT
DEMOLISHING ANY AFFORDABLE UNITS. THOSE ARE COMMERCIAL PARCELS ABSENT RESIDENTIAL RENTERS PLUS
PARCELS THAT HAVE NEVER BEEN DEVELOPED PLUS UTILITARIAN
STRUCTURES OWNED BY THE CITY AND MANY NONPROFITS SUCH AS
OURS THE CATHOLIC CHURCH INCLUDING LABOR UNIONS AND THE CITY ITSELF. THESE ARE ALL PARCELS THAT
DON'T INCLUDE RENTERS. FOR THIS REASON WE ARE
PROPOSING THIS AMENDMENT TO THE ORDINANCES TO 5771 NO PERMITS
ISSUED AS A RESULT OF THESE ORDINANCES SHALL DIMINISH THE
HABITABILITY REMOVED FROM THE MARKETPLACE OR DEMOLISH ANY
RENT CONTROL UNIT IN THE CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO.
THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS.
