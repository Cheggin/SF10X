THAT WE SUPPORT AND WORK WITH. YOU KNOW, I'M I'M A NATIVE SAN
FRANCISCO AND I LOVE THIS CITY AND AND I FEEL THAT BUSINESSES
HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO BE PARTNERS AND TO BE MORE THAN
PRIVATE ENTERPRISES, THAT THEY HAVE A PUBLIC PURPOSE AND THAT
PURPOSE SHOULD BE TO UPLIFT AND TO RECOGNIZE THOSE THAT
IN ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES THAT NEED LOVE AND SUPPORT.
AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT I LEARNED FROM MY FATHER AT A
VERY YOUNG AGE THAT ANY TIME HE WHEN I WAS WORKING IN THE STORE
WITH HIM, ANY TIME THAT ANYONE THAT CAME INTO THE STORE THAT WAS HUNGRY HE WOULD ASK ME TO MAKE A SANDWICH FOR THEM
AND FEED THEM. AND THAT I THINK IS ONE THING
ONE THING THAT EVERY BUSINESS THAT DOES BUSINESS IN SAN
FRANCISCO SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT THEY HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY
BEYOND MAKING A PROFIT. AND I THINK THAT THAT'S ONE OF
THE THINGS THAT THAT HAS MADE BY RIGHT DIFFERENT AND HAS
BROUGHT US HERE TODAY ANYWAY. SO I'M I'M GRATEFUL AND YOU
KNOW SUPERVISOR MOHAMOUD I'M EXCITED ABOUT THE THE NONPROFIT
GROCERY STORE TOO. I THINK YOU KNOW, WE'VE MADE
SOME GREAT STRIDES FORWARD IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS.
I THINK WE'VE GOT THE RIGHT SUPPORT IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO
PUSH IT FORWARD. SUPERVISOR WALTON, I LOOK
FORWARD TO TALKING TO YOU ABOUT IT SOON. IT'S IT'S SLATED TO HAPPEN IN THE IN THE SUNNYDALE ACROSS
THE STREET FROM THE HUB AND I'M ALSO VERY EXCITED TO TO SEE
WHAT AND HOPEFULLY MAYORAL CANDIDATE MAMDANI IN NEW YORK
CITY ACTUALLY GETS ELECTED AND AND GETS TO REALIZE HIS
VISION OF CREATING STATUS AND YOU KNOW PUBLICLY SUPPORTED
GROCERY STORES IN EACH OF THE BOROUGHS IN MANHATTAN SO THAT
WE CAN BEGIN TO SEE A MODEL WHERE GOOD FOOD IS ACCESSIBLE
TO MORE PEOPLE BECAUSE EVERY EVERY CITIZEN OF THIS OF THIS
COUNTRY DESERVES TO BE ABLE TO EAT EVERY DAY THERE THERE ARE
FAR TOO MANY PEOPLE THAT ARE HUNGRY, ESPECIALLY CHILDREN
AND IT'S IT'S INCUMBENT UPON ALL OF US AS LEADERS EVERY
SINGLE ONE OF US IS A LEADER TO DO OUR PART IN MAKING SURE THAT
WE FEED PEOPLE AND TAKE CARE OF EACH OTHER BECAUSE WE AT THE
END OF THE DAY WE NEED EACH OTHER IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO GET THROUGH EVERYTHING THAT'S COMING AT US EVERY DAY.
SO I APPRECIATE YOU ALL. >> THANK YOU SO THANK YOU ALL.
THANK YOU ALL RIGHT. AND WITH THAT I THINK WE GO TO

ROLLCALL FIRST MEMBER TO INTRODUCE NEW BUSINESS.
HIS SUPERVISOR CHAN SUBMIT. THANK YOU SUPERVISOR CHEN
SUBMIT. THANK YOU SUPERVISOR DORSEY
SUBMIT THANK YOU SUPERVISOR AND GAUDIO SUBMIT THANK YOU
SUPERVISOR FIELDER SUBMIT. THANK YOU.
SUPERVISOR MAHMOOD SUBMIT. THANK YOU. SUPERVISOR MENDELSOHN SUBMIT SUBMIT.
>> THANK YOU. SUPERVISOR MELGAR SUBMIT.
>> THANK YOU. SUPERVISOR SAUTER OKAY, I'M
GOING TO INTERRUPT THAT. WHAT I'M SORRY MADE I PROMISE
IT'S FOR A GOOD REASON. SO COLLEAGUES TODAY I AM
CALLING FOR A HEARING ON THE CURRENT PERFORMANCE AND FUTURE
EXTENSION OF THE CENTRAL SUBWAY.
AS YOU KNOW THE CENTRAL SUBWAY HAS BEEN OPEN SINCE NOVEMBER
2022 AND THIS FOLLOWED MORE THAN TWO DECADES OF PLANNING
AND COMMUNITY ADVOCACY PARTICULARLY FROM THE CHINATOWN
COMMUNITY. AND I THINK IT'S NOW TIME TO EXAMINE WHAT IS WORKING WHERE WE'VE FALLEN SHORT AND WHAT'S
NEXT. SO OUR HEARING WILL SEEK TO
ADDRESS THE FOLLOWING FIRST TO EXAMINE THE CURRENT PERFORMANCE
OF THE CENTRAL SUBWAY. WE HAVE A LOT TO LEARN FROM THE
MANY MISTAKES AND DELAYS IN GETTING IT OPEN OF COURSE, BUT I BELIEVE THERE'S ALSO PROMISING NUMBERS FOR US TO
HIGHLIGHT. >> FOR EXAMPLE APRIL AND MAY OF
THIS YEAR SET CONSECUTIVE RECORDS FOR HIGHEST RIDERSHIP
MONTHS EVER AND 2025 THE CLOSURE DATES WITHSTANDING SHOW
A 15% YEAR OVER YEAR RIDERSHIP GROWTH ON THE LINE.
>> NEXT I EXPECT OUR HEARING TO PRODUCE A SET OF SPECIFIC SHORT
TERM IMPROVEMENTS THAT S.F. MTA WILL COMMIT TO THAT WILL
DELIVER CONCRETE IMPROVEMENTS TO SPEED RELIABILITY
AND OPERATIONS OF THE SUBWAY. WE WANT TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE
OPPORTUNITIES TO SPEED UP THE TRAIN AT BOTTLENECKS THROUGHOUT THE SYSTEM. FOUR AS QUICKLY AS THE TRAIN
MOVES UNDERGROUND. WE'VE ALL BEEN IN THAT
UNFORTUNATE SITUATION WHEN WE ARE ABOVE GROUND AND SEE
PEDESTRIANS ON THE SIDEWALK WALKING FASTER THAN WE MOVE ON THE TRAIN. >> WE ALSO EXPECT COMMITMENTS
ON HOW THE CHINATOWN ROSE PARK STATION WILL AVOID CONTINUED
BREAKDOWNS OF ITS ELEVATORS AND ESCALATORS THAT FORCE
SENIORS TO CLIMB HUNDREDS OF STAIRS.
AND WE WANT DETAILS ON WHEN THE EMPTY RETAIL KIOSKS IN UNION SQUARE IN CHINATOWN WILL OPEN. FINALLY, OUR HEARING SHOULD
ADDRESS THE OUTLOOK AND SPECIFIC NEXT STEPS FOR AN
EXTENSION OF THE CENTRAL SUBWAY TO NORTH BEACH AND FISHERMAN'S
WHARF. WE'VE ALREADY STUDIED THIS EXTENSION FOR MORE THAN A DECADE.
A 2014 CITY STUDY SHOWED A TWO STATION EXTENSION WOULD LIKELY
BOOST RIDERSHIP BY 55%. >> WE ALSO KNOW THAT THIS
EXTENSION WOULD COMPETE FAVORABLY FOR FEDERAL FUNDING WHEN SUCH FUNDING IS AVAILABLE TO SAN FRANCISCO AGAIN.
LET'S GET READY NOW SO WE CAN MAKE THE CASE FOR HOW IMPORTANT
THIS EXTENSION IS AND WE CAN WIN THESE FUNDS IN THE NEAR
FUTURE. AND LET'S REMEMBER THE CENTRAL SUBWAY TUNNEL IS ALREADY DUG ALL THE WAY TO NORTH BEACH.
SINCE 2014, FOR MORE THAN TEN YEARS NOW AN EMPTY TUNNEL HAS
BEEN SITTING UNDER TENS OF THOUSANDS OF RESIDENTS IN ONE
OF THE COUNTRY'S DENSEST NEIGHBORHOODS.
I CALL FOR THIS HEARING WITH FULL AWARENESS THAT WE ARE
IN THE MIDST OF A FINANCIAL CRISIS FOR OUR TRANSIT SYSTEMS HERE IN SAN FRANCISCO AND NATIONWIDE.
>> WE CAN AND MUST KEEP OUR FOCUS SQUARELY ON FINDING MORE
SUSTAINABLE FUNDING, IMPROVING OPERATIONS AND AVOIDING A
LOOMING FISCAL CLIFF. BUT WE ALSO NEED TO GIVE OUR
TRANSIT RIDERS SOMETHING TO BELIEVE IN. WE MUST SHOW THAT OUR SYSTEM IS ALWAYS STRIVING TO BE BETTER
AND DELIVER A WORLD CLASS TRANSIT SERVICE THAT WE ALL
DESERVE. >> THIS IS WHAT OUR VOTERS
AND RESIDENTS OF SAN FRANCISCO NEED. IF WE ARE TO PASS FUTURE FUNDING MEASURES AND IN THIS
CASE WE MUST FINALLY REACH THE FULL PROMISE OF THE CENTRAL
SUBWAY PROJECT. BECAUSE DELAYS AND ENDLESS
STUDIES WITH NO FOLLOW UPS HAVE CONSEQUENCE THIS PLENTY OF PAST
MISTAKES HAVE GOTTEN US TO THE SITUATION TODAY BUT WE CANNOT
ALLOW OUR GENERATION IN THIS BOARD TO MAKE THOSE SAME MISTAKES. I WAS REMINDED OF THIS RECENTLY
WHEN I READ AN OP ED FROM TOMMY, A 16 YEAR OLD HIGH
SCHOOL STUDENT AT JEWISH COMMUNITY HIGH SCHOOL OF THE
BAY WHO CALLED FOR THAT EXTENSION AND A WONDERFUL OP ED. AND I'M REMINDED OF THIS EVERY
TIME I LOOK AT MY DAUGHTER NOW THREE MONTHS OLD AND WONDER HOW
OLD SHE WILL BE WHEN SHE CAN RIDE THE CENTRAL SUBWAY AS IT
WAS MEANT TO BE. >> IT'S NOT TOO MUCH TO ASK FOR
THE DENSEST NEIGHBORHOODS IN SAN FRANCISCO WITH SOME OF
THE LOWEST CAR OWNERSHIP RATES IN THE ENTIRE COUNTRY. TO HAVE ACCESS TO A SUBWAY I LOOK FORWARD TO OUR HEARING TO
SHOW HOW WE CAN FINALLY DELIVER THIS AND THE REST I SUBMIT.
>> THANK YOU SUPERVISOR SAUTER .
SUPERVISOR CHERYL SMITH SUBMIT. THANK YOU AND SUPERVISOR WALTON
SUBMIT. THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT.
>> SEEING NO NAMES ON THE ROSTER, THAT CONCLUDES THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW BUSINESS. THANK YOU MADAM CLERK.
I REALIZE I MAY HAVE SHOUTED AT THE WRONG PERSON A SUBCOMMITTEE
DID T V TODAY SO IF JAMES COHEN IS OUT THERE HELPING US I WANT TO THANK JAMES KAWANA AND WITH THAT WE CAN DO 14 MINUTES OF
PUBLIC COMMENTS SO WE ARE GOING TO DO A FIRST ROUND OF PUBLIC
COMMENT. >> IF WE ARE NOT FINISHED WE'LL
COME BACK TO IT LATER. THANK YOU MR. PRESIDENT. SO IF YOU'LL LINE UP ON YOUR RIGHT HAND SIDE OF THE CHAMBER
NEXT TO THE CURTAINS YOU PUBLIC COMMENT YOU ARE ABLE TO SPEAK
ON THE MAYORAL APPEARANCE. YOU'RE ABLE TO SPEAK ON WHETHER OR NOT THE BOARD SHOULD GO INTO CLOSED SESSION ON THE P, G
AND E LITIGATION THAT IS ITEM OF 445 AND YOU CAN SPEAK TO
ITEMS 40 SIX THROUGH 50. >> THOSE ARE ON THE ADOPTION
WITHOUT REFERENCE TO COMMITTEE. >> I'LL REPEAT AGAIN YOU MAY NOT SPEAK TO THE BUDGET ITEMS AS THOSE ITEMS HAVE ALREADY HAD
THEIR PUBLIC COMMENT AND WE'LL HEAR FROM OUR FIRST SPEAKER

AND DOESN'T WATCH. SO SOONER OR LATER YOU SEE BECAUSE THE KIDS KNOW TOO THEY ARE THERE.
>> THIS COULD BEAUTIFUL I SHOULD SAY BUT IT'S FOR THE
KIDS. >> SO ANYWAY, I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING MUCH MORE IMPORTANT TO SAY TODAY.
>> I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT ENOUGH WHAT?
IT'S YEAH, EVERYTHING MATTERS. REMEMBER THIS ONE? EVERYTHING THING MATTERS. >> EVERYTHING THEY JUST AN

FROM OUR NEXT SPEAKER PLEASE WELCOME.
HELLO MY NAME IS LIAM MCKEEVER. >> I LIVE IN D SIX I AM REALLY
CONFUSED ABOUT SAN FRANCISCO'S IMMIGRANT SANCTUARY STATUS.
>> I HAVE BEEN GOING OVER TO ICE COURT ON A WEEKLY BASIS
AND FIGHTING WITH ICE. >> THERE'S LIKE THESE CLASHES
BETWEEN ICE AND PEOPLE THAT DON'T WANT PEOPLE ABDUCTED
AND DEPORTED TO SOUTH SUDAN OR SOME CONCENTRATION CAMP
IN SOUTH AMERICA OR ALCATRAZ OR ALLIGATOR ALCATRAZ.
THE CONFRONTATION INS ARE GETTING MORE AND MORE VIOLENT
EVERY TIME PEOPLE ARE LIKE BEING RAMMED INTO BY THESE ICE
VEHICLES SOMEONE IS GOING TO GET HURT TODAY I WAS ASKING
SFPD WHAT THEIR ROLE IS HERE BECAUSE THEY STAND BY THEY
CLEAR THE ROAD FOR ICE OPERATIONS.
THEY LET THE VANS WITH THE ABDUCTED PEOPLE, MAKE SURE THEY
CAN GO THROUGH THE CITY. >> THEY SAY THEY'RE NOT
FACILITATING AN ICE OPERATION AND I TELL YOU IT VERY MUCH
FEELS LIKE FROM MY POINT OF VIEW THEY ARE SO CAN YOU PLEASE
DO YOUR JOB? >> CAN YOU CAN YOU DEFINE WHAT
THIS SANCTUARY STATUS ACTUALLY IS AND THEN ENFORCE IT?
YOU KNOW, I'M REALLY GLAD I HAVE MY WIFE WHO IS A
TRANSGENDER WOMAN BECAUSE I JUST DON'T GET MAD ON MY OWN
BEHALF ANYMORE WHEN THESE DOUBLE STANDARDS ARE HELD FOR
CIVILITY, HOW I'M SUPPOSED TO TALK TO YOU AFTER WITNESSING
WHAT I DO EARLIER TODAY WITH AND ICE AND MY PEOPLE BEING
ABDUCTED YOU KNOW SHE STILL GETS MAD ON MY BEHALF.
SHE GETS MAD AT THE DOUBLE STANDARDS HERE AND SHE GETS MAD
THAT WHITE MEN CAN CALL ME A VERY OFFENSIVE SLUR REPEATEDLY
DIRECT HIS COMMENT AT ME WHILE I'M SITTING BACK HERE WITH THE PUBLIC AND THAT'S NOT GIVEN AS MUCH RECOMMENDATION AS I AM
GIVEN FOR SAYING THE F-WORD. >> I JUST TELL HER IT'S A STATE
OF BEING TRANS IN AMERICA A TRANS MEXICAN-AMERICAN AT THE
MOMENT. THANK YOU LIAM MCKEEVER FOR
YOUR COMMENTS. CAN WE HEAR FROM OUR NEXT
SPEAKER? PLEASE WELCOME MISS BROWN.
COME HERE. YOU'RE NOT DOING ANYTHING. >> JUST STAND OVER HERE. >> COME IN THE MIRROR.
OKAY. I'M HERE TODAY WITH MY
GRANDCHILDREN. I MEAN IN A MIRROR.
THEY'RE TWINS AND I'M HERE TO, YOU KNOW, TALK ABOUT THEIR
THEIR THEIR THEIR UNCLE THAT PASSED AWAY NEXT MONTH WILL BE
THE I MEAN AUGUST 14TH WILL BE THE ANNIVERSARY OF HIS MURDER
AND I'VE BEEN COMING TO THESE CHAMBERS AND THE POLICE
COMMISSION FOR YEARS. IT'LL BE 20 YEARS THIS YEAR
AND MY TWO GRANDCHILDREN ARE GROWING UP WITHOUT THEIR UNCLE.
I HAVE 12 GRANDCHILDREN THAT DON'T HAVE AN UNCLE TO LOOK UP
TO. I ASKED THAT ON THE ANNIVERSARY
OF HIS DEATH THAT YOU THAT MOST OF YOU WOULD SHOW UP ON GROVE
STREET TO REPRESENT UNSOLVED HOMICIDES TO BRING AWARENESS TO
ALL THE UNSOLVED HOMICIDES TO HELP MOTHERS LIKE MYSELF.
I DO APPRECIATE THAT THAT'S NEW.
THE POLICY THAT THAT'S BEEN PASSED ABOUT WAYS TO PAY
TIPSTERS HAVE BEEN PASSED. I'M PRAYING THAT THE MAYOR COME
AND SIGN THAT POLICY SO THAT HE CAN, YOU KNOW, LET THE MOTHERS
KNOW THAT HE DO CARE. >> SO I'M PRAYING THAT HE WILL
COME AND SIGN THAT POLICY WITH US AND HAVE US AT LEAST STAND
WITH HIM. AND I THANK YOU, MATT DARCY FOR
FOUR FOR A MONTH FOR DOING THIS FOR US AND PLEASE DON'T STOP
WORKING FOR US. THANK YOU.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS. ALL RIGHT.
LET'S HEAR FROM OUR NEXT SPEAKER.
>> >> HELLO, MY NAME IS JASON WYMAN.
I HAVE LIVED ON THE CORNER OF 20TH AND HAMPSHIRE FOR OVER 20
YEARS. >> IN THAT COURSE OF THE TIME
THAT'S BEEN DISTRICT 6 TO 16 AND NOW DISTRICT NINE.
AND I WANT TO SPEAK TO WHAT I HEARD AS THE PRIORITIES OF SAN
FRANCISCO FROM THE MAYOR TODAY. >> WHAT I HEARD WAS PUBLIC
SAFETY, CLEAN STREETS AND STRONG RECOVERY IN MY
EXPERIENCE WORKING IN THIS CITY AND IN THIS TOWN IT SEEMS LIKE
THOSE ACTUALLY AREN'T THE COMMITMENTS CURRENTLY ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE STATE OF SAN FRANCISCO.
>> WHAT SEEMS TO BE THE COMMITMENTS OF SAN FRANCISCO
ARE RENEGING ON COMMITMENTS AND SLASHING BUDGETS VERY SPECIFICALLY FOR THE SAN FRANCISCO DREAM KEEPER
INITIATIVE FUNDING. THAT WAS A COMMITMENT MADE BY
THE CITY THAT IT RENEGED ON. >> IT ALSO SEEMS TO BE A
PRIORITY THAT WE ARE PRIVATIZING EVERYTHING.
>> I JUST RECENTLY FOUND OUT THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE CHARGING FOR PARKING IN GOLDEN GATE PARK.
>> WHAT ARE WE DOING? DO WE NOT HAVE ANY FREE
RESOURCES IN THIS CITY OR THE THIRD THING THAT I WANT TO TALK
ABOUT SPECIFICALLY YES. >> WHAT IS YOUR TIME JUST FOR A MOMENT YOUR TIME IS PAUSED. THE BUDGET MATTERS THAT I READ
OFF EARLIER. >> I HEAR YOU. THESE ARE PRIORITIES OF SAN FRANCISCO NOT JUST FUNDING
PRIORITIES OF SAN FRANCISCO. >> BEGIN YOUR TIME.
THANK YOU. THREE SECONDS LEFT. THE THIRD PRIORITY THAT I KEEP HEARING ABOUT IS PUBLIC SAFETY
. >> ON JULY THE 4TH I CAN TELL YOU THAT RIGHT OUTSIDE MY HOME THERE WAS A MILITARIZED POLICE
PRESENCE. THEY CAME DOWN BOTH SIDES OF
HAMPSHIRE STREET AND THEY CAME DOWN 20TH STREET IN FORMATION
WITH THE BATONS AT THEIR READY. THEY MADE THREATS TO THE COMMUNITY THAT WAS SETTING OFF SOME FIREWORKS RIGHT THERE ON
20TH THAT HAVE BEEN DOING IT FOR OVER 20 YEARS.
AGAIN, I HAVE LIVED THERE FOR OVER 20 YEARS. IT IS A REGULAR OCCURRENCE EVERY SINGLE YEAR.
I HAVE NEVER SEEN S.F. PD IN MILITARY FORMATION MARCHED
ON THE STREET, ISSUE COMMANDS AND TELL MY NEIGHBORS THAT IF
ANYONE WERE TO LAY HANDS ON A POLICE VEHICLE THEY WOULD BE
MET WITH ASSAULT. THAT WAS STATED BY S.F. PD ON
JULY THE FOURTH. THAT IS NOT PUBLIC SAFETY.
THAT IS PUBLIC TERROR AND THAT IS PUBLIC TERROR AS WE CONTINUE
TO SEE ICE SHOW UP IN SAN FRANCISCO.
SO AGAIN, IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE MAYOR'S PRIORITIES ARE NOT
ACTUALLY THEIR RHETORICAL PRIORITIES.
THEY ARE NOT ACTUAL PRIORITIES OF THE CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO AND IT'S REALLY DISAPPOINTING. >> THANK YOU.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS. >> WELCOME TO THE NEXT SPEAKER
AND WE'RE PROBABLY ONLY GOING TO BE ABLE TO TAKE 1 OR 2 MORE
FOLKS BEFORE OUR 3 P.M. SPECIAL ORDER. >> THANK YOU AND THEN WE'LL COME BACK LATER.
>> GOOD AFTERNOON SUPERVISORS. MY NAME IS APPLE. I'M A RESIDENT OF DISTRICT SEVEN AND I'M SPEAKING FROM
LIVED EXPERIENCE OVER TEN YEARS UNHOUSED ON THE STREETS OF SAN
FRANCISCO AND YOU'RE STRUGGLING WITH SUBSTANCE USE.
I'M HERE TO STRONGLY OPPOSE MAYOR THE MAYOR'S BREAKING THE
CYCLE INITIATIVE AND THE PROPOSAL TO RE ALLOCATE PROPERLY FUNDS AWAY FROM THEIR ORIGINAL PURPOSE PROPERTY WAS
PASSED BY VOTERS WITH A CLEAR MANDATE TO FUND PERMANENT
HOUSING, VOLUNTARY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND HARM
REDUCTION NOT INVOLUNTARY TREATMENT OR CARE SCHOOL SYSTEMS REDIRECTING 90 MILLION UNSPENT PROP C FUNDS TO
BREAKING THE CYCLE WITHOUT MEANINGFUL COMMUNITY
ENGAGEMENT. >> MA'AM, I'M PAUSING YOUR TIME
. THAT MATTER IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE BUDGET THAT WE HAVE CONTINUED TO NEXT WEEK.
IT HAS ALREADY HAD ITS PUBLIC COMMENT SO I CAN'T I CAN'T
FINISH MOMENT IF YOU WANT TO TELL US ABOUT YOUR EXPERIENCE.
HAPPY TO TAKE THAT BUT DON'T TALK ABOUT ITEM 32 ON THE
AGENDA. THAT'S THE PROP C THAT YOU WERE
REFERRING TO. >> OKAY. I CAN SPEAK FROM MY OWN EXPERIENCE.
>> I'LL RESUME YOUR TIME. THANK YOU.
WHILE I CAN'T SPEAK FOR EVERYBODY BECAUSE EVERY CRISIS IS DIFFERENT, I CAN'T SPEAK FOR MY EXPERIENCE AT 16 YEARS OLD I
WAS FORCED INTO A LOCKED MENTAL HEALTH FACILITY FOR NEARLY A
YEAR. IT WAS TRAUMATIC. I WAS CONSERVED, HELD AGAINST MY WILL AND DENIED DIGNITY
AND AUTONOMY OVER MY OWN LIFE. IT DIDN'T BREAK THE CYCLE FOR
ME. IT DEEPENED IT AND SPIRALED ME FURTHER INTO CRISIS POVERTY AND ADDICTION FOR YEARS.
IF THE CYCLE IS JAILS, HOSPITALS AND BEING BACK TO THE
STREETS I LIVED THAT WHAT FINALLY BROKE THE CYCLE FOR ME
WASN'T FORCE IT WAS LOW BARRIER VOLUNTARY CARE AND ACCESS TO
PERMANENT HOUSING. >> SO PLEASE REJECT THIS
REALLOCATION. >> THANK YOU.
SO IF THERE ARE ANY OTHER MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WHO ARE IN LINE THAT EXPECT TO TALK ABOUT ITEM 32 OR PROPOSITION C
,THAT IS NOT ALLOWED. I WILL BE REDIRECTING YOU AS WELL. >> WELCOME.
THANK YOU. WHAT OF SUPERVISOR MEMBERS
TODAY? I JUST WANT TO REITERATE A
QUOTE THAT'S SAID EVERY TIME THAT WE GO THROUGH BUDGET
ISSUES IN THIS CITY IS SHOW ME YOUR BUDGET AND I'LL SHOW YOU
WHAT YOU CARE ABOUT. AND BY THAT MEASURE, SAN FRANCISCO'S VALUES ARE LOUD AND CLEAR AND DEEPLY
DISAPPOINTING FOR THE BLACK COMMUNITY.
THE LARGEST DIVESTMENT IN THIS YEAR'S CITY BUDGET HAS COME AT
THE DIRECT EXPENSE OF BLACK SAN FRANCISCANS PROGRAMS CREATED TO
UPLIFT, STABILIZE AND EMPOWER COMMUNITIES PARTICULARLY AND D
TEN AND D FIVE HAVE BEEN QUIETLY DEFUNDED OR DEPRIORITIZED AND THE SAME RESIDENTS WHO HAVE HAD LONG
CARRIED THE WEIGHT OF THE SYSTEMIC INEQUALITY WERE
EXCLUDED FROM MEANINGFUL BUDGET CONVERSATIONS UNTIL AFTER THE
DECISIONS BY THIS BOARD HAD HARDLY BEEN MADE AS WELL AS THE
MAYOR. >> THIS STANDS IN DIRECT CONTRADICTION TO THE PUBLIC COMMITMENTS MADE JUST A FEW
YEARS AGO. MOST OF THE MEMBERS OF THIS
BOARD OF SUPERVISORS MARCHED IN THE STREETS DURING THE GEORGE FLOYD UPRISINGS WITH MANY OTHER COMMUNITY MEMBERS.
MANY STOOD BESIDE COMMUNITY, RAISED FISTS WITH US
AND PUBLICLY PLEDGED TO REIMAGINE PUBLIC SAFETY
AND INVEST IN BLACK COMMUNITIES. THOSE ACTIONS MATTERED BUT THEY MUST BE BACKED BY POLICY
FUNDING AND FOLLOW THROUGH. WE ARE HERE TODAY ASKING THIS
BOARD TO UPHOLD THAT PROMISE. THE BLACK COMMUNITY DEMANDS THE
FOLLOWING ACTIONS A CITYWIDE AUDIT OF THE DREAM KEEPERS
INITIATIVE AND WE CALL FOR A FULL AND TRANSPARENT AUDIT. ALLOCATE OUT OF EVERY SINGLE DOLLAR THAT HAS BEEN ALLOCATED
TO EVERY CITY DEPARTMENT IN THE CITY SINCE THE PROGRAM'S LAUNCH
INCLUDING HOW MUCH WAS ACTUALLY SPENT ON THE BLACK COMMUNITIES
AND HOW MUCH WENT TO INTERMEDIARIES, NON-BLACK LED ORGANIZATIONS AND REMAINED UNSPENT.
WE ALSO ARE REQUESTING A FULL ACCOUNTING OF UNPAID INVOICES
OWED TO BLACK LED ORGANIZATIONS AS WELL AS A FULL RESCINDING
AND REISSUE OF THE CURRENT HRC RFP 100.
WE CALL FOR THE IMMEDIATE CANCELLATION AND RE ISSUANCE OF
THE RFP DUE TO LACK OF CLARITY AND TRANSPARENCY IN THE PROCESS
. CONTRADICTORY AND DISCRIMINATORY EVALUATION AND LANGUAGE WITHIN THE RFP AS
WELL AS A MEASURABLE REVERSAL OF THAT THAT THAT BASICALLY
GIVES A MEASURABLE REVERSAL OF PROGRESS EMERGING FROM BLACK.
>> THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS .
SO I THINK WE WILL COME BACK TO PUBLIC COMMENT AFTER OUR 3 P.M.
SPECIAL ORDER. >> SO WE WILL RESUME PUBLIC COMMENT BUT IT WILL BE IN A BIT OF TIME.
MADAM CLERK, CAN YOU PLEASE CALL OUR 3 P.M. SPECIAL ORDER?
>> YES, THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS WILL CONVENE AS A
COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE. THIS IS SCHEDULED PURSUANT TO A
RESOLUTION NUMBER 208 DASH 25 ADOPTED ON MAY 6TH, 2025 FOR A
PUBLIC HEARING OF THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS TODAY TO CONSIDER

WILL INTRODUCE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO THE MANAGEMENT PLAN AND ENGINEER'S REPORT EACH DATED JULY 2025 AND ALSO
INCLUDED IN YOUR FILE. AND I AM ALSO ANTICIPATING THAT

THE DEPARTMENT OF ELECTIONS WILL COUNT ALL BALLOTS SUBMITTED INCLUDING ANY ADDITIONAL BALLOTS RECEIVED
DURING THE BUSINESS HEARING. THE BUSINESS HEARING TODAY
AND SUBMIT THE TABULATION TO THE BOARD. MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC MAY VIEW THE BALLOT TABULATION BY THE
DEPARTMENT OF ELECTIONS ON THE BASEMENT LEVEL OF CITY HALL

SUPERVISORS WILL NOT APPROVE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE

TO ESTABLISH THE DISTRICT AND IMPOSE THE ASSESSMENTS.
A MAJORITY PROTEST WILL EXIST IF THE WEIGHTED BALLOTS ARE SUBMITTED IN OPPOSITION TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE ASSESSMENT

THANK YOU. TAKE ALL GOOD AFTERNOON
SUPERVISORS. IT'S GOOD TO SEE MANY OF YOU.
THANK YOU ALL FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT.
I'D LIKE TO ECHO MANY OF JACKIE'S THANKS TO SUPERVISOR
MELGAR SUPERVISOR CHEN AND STAFF FOR ALL THE SUPPORT
OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS WE CERTAINLY WOULDN'T BE HERE
WITHOUT YOU AND YOU KNOW WE WE AIM TO KEEP THE COMMUNITY
THRIVING AND MOVING FORWARD SO COULDN'T DO WITHOUT YOU APPRECIATE YOU WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHERE WE HAVE
BEEN AND WHERE WE'RE GOING WITH THIS RENEWAL AND I WILL START
WITH A LITTLE HISTORY ABOUT THE OSA ESTABLISHED IN 2010 AND TO
DO CLEANING MAINTENANCE AND BUSINESS SUPPORT ON THE
CORRIDOR AND I STARTED IN 2023 FOLLOWING THE STRATEGIC PLAN
THAT THE ORGANIZATION ENACTED IN ORDER TO IMPROVE OUR OUR
BOARD RELATIONS AND OUR COMMUNITY RELATIONS AS WELL AS
OUR OPERATIONS. SO FOLLOWING THE SPRING AUDIT
WE ADDRESSED ALL OF THE FINDINGS GETTING OUR FISCAL
HOUSE IN ORDER, PUTTING BEST PRACTICES IN FOR ACCOUNTS
PAYABLE AND RECEIVABLE AND INCREASING TRANSPARENT AC
AND OPENNESS IN OUR OPERATING PROCEDURES.
AND I'M HAPPY TO REPORT THAT THAT AUDIT WAS CLOSED IN 2024
AND WE ADDRESSED ALL 19 FINDINGS OF WHICH ENABLED US TO
FOCUS MORE ON THE FUN STUFF WHICH IS A DIZZYING ARRAY OF
COMMUNITY EVENTS, BEAUTIFICATION PROJECTS
AND ENHANCED CLEANING AND MAINTENANCE PROGRAM THAT
PROVIDES DAILY SWEEPING WEEKLY PRESSURE WASHING LANDSCAPING,
OTHER BEAUTIFICATION PROJECTS ON THE CORRIDOR THAT MAKES THE
THE AVENUE FEEL CLEAN AND CARED FOR DAY IN AND DAY OUT.
SO BY THE NUMBERS WE COMPLETED 43,547 TASKS ALONG THE MAIN
OCEAN AVENUE CORRIDOR NOT COUNTING LAKESIDE VILLAGE.
THIS HAS BEEN DONE PREDOMINANTLY BY OUR ONE FULL
TIME AMBASSADOR ROLAND WHO SUPERVISES AND MELGAR SHOUTED
OUT EARLIER HE'S THE REAL MVP HERE DAY IN, DAY OUT DOING THE
DIRTY WORK. AND THEN MOST RECENTLY WE
ADOPTED THE LAKESIDE VILLAGE CORRIDOR COMPLETING 2650 TASKS
ALONG LAKESIDE VILLAGE FUNDED BY A GRANT THAT ALLOWS FOR
ROLAND TO GO DOWN THERE THREE DAYS A WEEK.
IN ADDITION THAT WORK COLLECTED ABOUT 62,025 POUNDS OF TRASH
WHICH IS ANYTHING FROM, YOU KNOW, LITTER TO TRASH THAT FELL
OUT OF WASTE RECEPTACLES RECOLOGY CANS THINGS LEFT
BEHIND BY THE UNHOUSED COMMUNITY YOU NAME IT
AND FECES, NEEDLES ALL THE HAZARDOUS WASTE AS WELL.
SO THAT'S MIXED IN WITH ALL OF THAT.
>> AND WE HAVE A SMALL TEAM OF LANDSCAPERS THAT COMES OUT ONCE
A WEEK DOING LIKE WEEDING TREE WELL CLEAN UP USING 311 CUTTING
LOW HANGING TREES COLLECTING LITTER AS WELL FILLING UP TRASH
BAGS, PLANTING TREES AND SWEEPING UP ANY LEAVES OR
DEBRIS THAT MAY HAVE ACCUMULATED.
SO WE'VE DONE OVER ALMOST 2000 LANDSCAPING TASKS BETWEEN OCEAN
AVENUE AND LAKESIDE VILLAGE OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS.
MOVING ON TO COMMUNITY EVENTS WE PROMOTED, SPONSORED OR
PARTICIPATED IN SEVERAL EVENTS CULTURAL CELEBRATIONS,
NETWORKING EVENTS, WINE WALKS, AN AWESOME BOBA FESTIVAL
BUSINESS NETWORKING EVENTS, ART SHOWS AND YOUTH EVENTS.
WE ALSO OPENED OUR OFFICE AT 1720 OCEAN AVENUE WHICH HAS
BEEN THE EPICENTER OF COMMUNITY ACTIVITY.
SO WE'VE DONE FITNESS SEMINARS, WELLNESS DAYS OBVIOUSLY HOSTING
OUR COMMUNITY MEETINGS AND BOARD MEETINGS THERE.
IT ALSO SERVES AS A PART TIME ART GALLERY AND EVENT SPACE.
SO THANKS TO ROSENDO AND GABE FOR KEEPING THAT SPACE ACTIVE
AND COMMUNITY SERVING AND THEN FINALLY THROUGH RESEND THOSE
WORK WITH THE CPD GRANT WE'VE DONE A NUMBER OF ADVOCACY
AND BUSINESS SUPPORT ACTIVITIES INCLUDING PROVIDING INFORMATION
AND ASSISTANCE ON GRANTS AND TAX CREDITS, TECHNICAL
BUSINESS SUPPORT AND PROMOTIONS .
SO WE TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT OUR CURRENT BUDGET WHICH IS
FROM THE ASSESSMENT ABOUT $378,000 BUT WE SUPPLEMENT THAT
WITH GRANTS AND EARNED INCOME. BUT IT IS A SHOESTRING BUDGET
AND IT'S REMARKABLE WHAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO.
BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT EXPANDING THAT AND INCLUDING
THE LAKESIDE VILLAGE PORTION. SO THE NEXT SLIDE WILL SHOW
WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING ON THE BALLOT AND THEN I'LL TALK A
LITTLE BIT ABOUT A SUPERVISOR CHANGE AMENDMENT.
>> SO OUR CURRENT BUDGET PROPOSED EXCUSE ME PROPOSED
BUDGET IN SERVICE AREA WOULD GIVE US A TOTAL BUDGET OF ABOUT
$500,000. AND WITH SUPERVISOR CHEN'S AMENDMENT AND THE NEXT SLIDE YOU'LL SEE A LITTLE BIT TAKEN
OUT OF THE GENEVA AREA WHICH IS ABOUT 40 OR SO PARCELS AND THAT
WOULD BRING OUR BUDGET DOWN TO $460,000 WHICH WE ARE PREPARED
TO WORK WITH. SO LOOKING AHEAD WHAT WE ARE
PROPOSING IS EXPENSE EXPANDING THE DISTRICT TO LAKESIDE
VILLAGE EXPANDING A LITTLE BIT OUR AMBASSADOR SERVICE COVERAGE
TO DO A LITTLE BIT MORE CLEANING AND MAINTENANCE
AND CONTINUING OUR BUSINESS SUPPORT WITH ONE FULL TIME
AMBASSADOR AND TO FULL TIME EMPLOYEES DOING THE OFFICE TYPE
OF WORK. SO WITH THAT I AM HAPPY TO TAKE
ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU.
>> THANK YOU. I DO NOT SEE ANY QUESTIONS SO
IT MAY BE TIME FOR US TO GO TO PUBLIC COMMENT.
MADAM CLERK LET'S OPEN TO PUBLIC COMMENT FOR THE HEARING. EVERY SPEAKER WILL BE ALLOTTED TWO MINUTES.

BUSINESSES AND ASSESSMENT ASSESSMENT WHICH WILL GO TO
BUSINESSES ALSO SOMEHOW WE WILL GO TO JUST A FEW RESIDENTIAL
PROPERTIES WHEN THEY SEE IN THE IN MY WINDOW I SEE OTHER HOUSES
THAT NOT INCLUDED BUT EVEN THERE CLOSER TO OCEAN AVENUE
THAN MY HOUSE SO I AM READY TO PAY FOR THE ASSESSMENT BUT I

MY NAME IS KATE FERRETTI. I HAVE LIVED IN THE BROADER OR
MY AREA FOR A LONG TIME MOST OF MY LIFE ALMOST THE ENTIRE POINT
OF MY LIFE. I AM AN INTERESTED MEMBER OF
THE COMMUNITY AND ALSO VERY ACTIVE IN THE COMMUNITY.
I AM HERE TO SPEAK STRONGLY IN FAVOR OF THE RENEWAL.
OCEAN AVENUE IS NOT JUST A COMMERCIAL CORRIDOR.
IT IS THAT ENTITY THAT KNITS OUR VERY DIVERSE COMMUNITIES
TOGETHER. AND AS THE OCEAN AVENUE
ASSOCIATION HAS BROUGHT FORTH NOT ONLY CLEANING AND GRAFFITI
REMOVAL AND THE INFRASTRUCTURE TYPE OF THINGS BUT IT'S THE
COMMUNITY BUILDING THAT AGAIN ACCENTUATES THAT BRINGING OUR
DIVERSE COMMUNITIES TOGETHER. WHAT IS ALSO VERY IMPORTANT
ABOUT HAVING THE OCEAN AVENUE ASSOCIATION AND THE RENEWAL IS
THAT IT IS GOVERNED BY THE PUBLIC LAWS.
THE BROWN ACT WHICH GUARANTEES THE EFFECT THAT THE PUBLIC HAS
THE RIGHT TO ADDRESS THE THE BOARD AND TO BE ABLE TO SPEAK
AS TO HOW THE MONEY IS GOING TO BE SPENT.
AND SO IT GUARANTEES THAT PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT WHICH IS SO
VERY IMPORTANT. SO AGAIN I SPEAKING AS SOMEBODY
WHO WAS ON THE STEERING COMMITTEE THE GRANTED FROM FOR
THE FORMATION OF THE CBD BACK IN EARLY 2000S BUT ALSO WITH AN
INTERESTED MEMBER OF THE COMMUNITY THAT IS ACTIVE BUT
ALSO TO URGE YOU TO ENTHUSIASTICALLY VOTE IN PRO
AND IN FAVOR OF THE RENEWAL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR.
>> THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. CIVIL SERVICE COMMISSION PRESIDENT THANK YOU FOR YOUR VOICE >> FOR IDENTIFICATION
PURPOSES ONLY. OF COURSE.
OF COURSE. >> WELCOME TO OUR NEXT SPEAKER.
HELLO, BOARD. I'M SPEAKING AGAIN ON BEHALF OF
SMALL BUSINESSES TO THE CITY AND SUPPORT OF THE OCEAN CBD.
I'VE SEEN THE WORK OF CHRIS MARTIN WHEN HE WORKED AT SOMA
CBD AND SUPPORTED A LOT OF SMALL BUSINESSES DURING THE COVID PANDEMIC ESPECIALLY ON FOLSOM STREET AND THE WORK THAT
THEY DID TO KEEP THOSE CLEAN STREETS CLEAN THE
RESPONSIVENESS FROM SMALL BUSINESSES WHEN THERE WAS FECES
AND NEEDLES ON THE FLOOR AS WELL AS POWER WASHING STREETS
THAT HAD URINE IN THEM. WE CALLED THEM AS EARLY AS SIX
IN THE MORNING SOMETIMES AND THEY GOT OUT THERE ON SUNDAY MORNINGS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE BUSINESSES THAT WERE
SHUTTERED WERE ABLE TO OPEN UP AND HAVE OUR BLOCK PARTIES
STREET CLOSURES AND SO FORTH. AND SO I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT
I STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS ITEM BEFORE TO REISSUE AND EXTEND
THE DISTRICTS CORRIDOR TO BE ABLE TO ALSO SUPPORT THE
LAKESHORE VILLAGE AS A PREEMPTIVE PREVIOUS ALUMNI OF
LOWELL ASSOCIATES OF LAW HIGH SCHOOL. WE USED TO GO TO THAT SHOPPING CENTER A LOT WHICH WAS BACK
IN THE DAYS LUCKY I'M DATING MYSELF BUT AN ARBY'S OVER THERE
. SO I REALLY THINK THAT AS MUCH THAT THE CITY AND THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS CAN DO TO SUPPORT
SMALL BUSINESSES ALONG THE CORRIDOR ESPECIALLY WITH MAKING
SURE THE AREAS ARE CLEAN SO THAT PEOPLE CAN CONDUCT
BUSINESS AND GET IN THEIR OFFICES IS GREAT. >> THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS.
>> LET'S HEAR FROM OUR NEXT SPEAKER. MY NAME IS SOLILOQUY CHANDLER AND I'M DEFINITELY IN SUPPORT
OF THIS ITEM UNFORTUNATELY I FEEL HE WAS ASKING TOO LITTLE.
YOU KNOW ALL OF THE MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT
HAVE BEEN SPENT IN THIS CITY IN REGARDS TO THINGS THAT HAVE
BEEN EVIL AND CORRUPTION. I THINK UNFORTUNATELY IF IT
WASN'T SUCH A LOW PRICE YOU PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN DENIED. WE HAVE SEEN THIS ALL OVER
AND IT'S TIME FOR US TO HOLD THE CITY ACCOUNTABLE IN REGARDS
TO WHEN IT COMES TO THE BLACK NATION. THEY CANNOT EVEN ASK FULLY WHAT THEY NEED TO START THEIR
BUSINESSES. SO ONCE AGAIN I AM IN AGREEANCE
TO THIS ITEM. >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS. >> NEXT SPEAKER HI MY NAME IS
ARUN THEY STERLING. I AM A RESIDENT OF D11, ALSO A
COMMUNITY ACTIVIST AND TEEN AS WELL TOO.
I HAVE A SMALL BUSINESS STERLING BUILDERS DOING
BUSINESS IN STERLING FRAMERS. I'M IN SUPPORT OF THE OCEAN AVENUE COMMUNITY BENEFITS. I'VE BEEN OVER THERE MY WHOLE
LIFE BUT ONE THING I DO WANT TO SAY ON RECORD IS THAT MAKE SURE
THAT WE ARE THAT YOU GUYS ARE REACHING OUT TO THE COMMUNITY,
TO SMALL BUSINESSES AS WELL TO DO THOSE PROJECTS OR WHATEVER PROJECTS THAT YOU GUYS HAVE OVER THERE AND ALSO TO REACH
OUT TO THE COMMUNITY FOR COMMUNITY EMPLOYMENT AS WELL
TOO. SO THAT'S THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS.
ALL RIGHT. LET'S HEAR FROM OUR NEXT
>> GOOD AFTERNOON TO EVERYONE. I'M A CALMING BASS THAT I AM A
PROPERTY OWNER IN OCEAN AVENUE. I'M JUST WONDERING BECAUSE A
THIS YEAR MY ASSESSMENT WAS 1895 IN I'M JUST WONDERING HOW
COME THAT BIG IT'S MORE THAN ONE THIRD OF MY PROPERTY TAX
AND IT MAYBE THE PRESENTATION IS REALLY GOOD BUT IF YOU WENT
TO A FROM THAT 13 HUNDRED DOWN THE TREES UP DYING NOBODY'S
MAINTAINING IT IN I WANT TO KNOW THE SERVICES PROVIDED
ACCOMPLISHMENT MADE AND WHAT WAS IT MAINTAIN IN MY AREA YOU
CAN SEE ALL THE TREES DYING AND NOBODY EVEN THE STRIP THEY
SAID THAT THEY THEY BOTHER WAS THE SIDEWALK THAT WHEN IT'S
THAT IT'S NOT BEEN OUR STREET THAT'S SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR
COMMENTS I'M GOING TO ASK JACKIE HAZELWOOD JUST TO MEET
WITH THE RESIDENT AND ANSWER SOME OF HER QUESTIONS FOR HER.
THANK YOU. LET'S HEAR FROM OUR NEXT SPEAKER. >> HI, MY NAME IS DENISE BURNS
AND I'M A RESIDENT OF LAKESIDE VILLAGE AND I'M ONE OF THE
CO-FOUNDERS OF THE LAKESIDE VILLAGE NONPROFIT IT I'M HERE
TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF JOINING THE OCEAN AVENUE ASSOCIATION
AND SINCE 2020 VOLUNTEERS LIKE ME HAVE BEEN DOING HEAVY
LIFTING TO IMPROVE THE COMMERCIAL CORRIDOR ON ASIAN OCEAN AVENUE AND LAKESIDE VILLAGE.
ONE OF OUR TOP PRIORITIES WAS AND STILL IS TO SUPPORT THE
SMALL LOCAL BUSINESSES WE ORGANIZED FREQUENT LITTER
PICKUPS. WE FUNDRAISED TO HAVE MURALS
PAINTED, TO HAVE MARKET LIGHTS INSTALLED ON THE SIDEWALKS
AND TO BEAUTIFY AND ADD PLANTS IN EVERY BIT OF EMPTY DIRT THAT
WAS AVAILABLE. WE JUST WANTED LOTS OF GREENERY
SO ALL THIS HARD WORK WAS DONE TO IMPROVE THE APPEAL AND THE
SAFETY OF THE AREA FOR BUSINESSES AND FOR THEIR
CUSTOMERS. >> IN 2023 WE STARTED TO WORK
WITH THE AA AND WOW WHAT A DIFFERENCE LIKE EVERYONE HAS
SAID THE POWER MACHINE THEY PULLED WEEDS, THEY PICKED UP LITTER AND THEY EVEN HELPED WHEN SOME OF THE VACANT
STOREFRONTS HAD THEIR WINDOWS SMASHED OR THEIR DOORS MATCH SO
POSITIVE FEEDBACK ACROSS THE BOARD.
SADLY WE HAD TO CANCEL THAT RELATIONSHIP THE SERVICES WITH
THE WAY BECAUSE OF THE ASSET PARK ALLIANCE AND THE FACT THAT
THEY'VE BEEN SHUT DOWN. >> SO AS A RESULT THE CORRIDOR
IS BEGINNING TO LOOK MESSY AGAIN TRASH CANS OVERFILLED
THINGS LEFT ON THE SIDEWALK. YOU KNOW WE MISS ROLL AND WE
MISS THE YOU KNOW WE MISS THE TEAM.
>> IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR VOLUNTEERS LIKE US TO RAISE THE
FUNDS TO MAINTAIN THE COMMERCIAL CORRIDOR IN A VIBRANT AND CLEAN FASHION. THE BEST PATH FORWARD IS FOR
LAKESIDE VILLAGE TO BECOME A PART OF.
OKAY. SO I ASK AND I HOPE THAT THE
PROPERTY OWNERS WILL VOTE IN FAVOR OF IT AND THAT YOU ALL WILL VOTE TO EXTEND IT EXPANDED AND RENEW IT.
THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS.
LET'S HEAR FROM OUR NEXT SPEAKER.
WELCOME. >> HELLO SUPERVISORS.
MY NAME IS DEBRA MITCHELL AND I GUESS I REPRESENT THE MUCH
BELEAGUERED PROPERTY OWNERS OF OCEAN AVENUE AND I WANTED TO
EXPLAIN WHY I AM VERY MUCH IN FAVOR OF JOINING THE
ASSOCIATION AND IT'S CERTAINLY NOT NEWS THAT THE FAILURES OF
OUR SOCIETY ARE ON THE STREETS AROUND US ALL AND WE NEED MORE
HELP DIRECTLY ON THE STREETS AND THIS IS WHAT IT'S PROVIDING
AS A PROPERTY OWNER I HAVE CLEANED UP FECES. I'VE HAD TO WAKE UNHOUSED PEOPLE IN THE MORNING.
I MEAN I TRY NOT TO WAKE THEM ACTUALLY I TRY TO WAIT TILL
THEY WAKE UP BUT STILL HAVING PEOPLE THERE FIRST THING IN THE
MORNING IS A HUGE HELP. IT'S MORE THAN ANY OF US CAN DO
INDIVIDUALLY AND WE JUST NEED TO PAY FOR THIS TO GET IT DONE.
IT'S OUR STREETS, IT'S OUR HOMES, IT'S OUR BUSINESSES.
>> IT'S OUR CITY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS. WELCOME TO OUR NEXT SPEAKER.
>> I THANK YOU. MY NAME IS RANDY SWINDELL
AND I'M HERE TO SUPPORT THE OCEAN AVENUE ASSOCIATION
AND THE EXTENSION TO LAKESIDE VILLAGE. I'M A BOARD MEMBER OF UNITY SPIRITUAL CENTER.
WE ARE THE PROPERTY OWNER AT THE CORNER OF 19TH AVENUE
AND OCEAN WHERE THAT CUTE LITTLE TURQUOISE CHURCH AND THE
OCEAN AVENUE ASSOCIATION PROVIDES IMPORTANT SERVICES TO
HELP CLEAN UP LITTER GRIME AND WORSE FROM OUR SIDEWALKS,
DOORWAYS AND GARDENS WE NEED OWNER'S HELP TO MAINTAIN
AND WEED THE SIDEWALKS, GARDENS REPLACE PLANTS WHEN THEY DIE.
WE'VE GOT A DYING TREE NEXT TO OUR PROPERTY AND WE JUST DON'T
HAVE ENOUGH VOLUNTEERS TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT KIND OF WORK
OURSELVES. >> AND WE DO HAVE AN ACTIVE VOLUNTEER COMMUNITY BUT IT'S JUST IT'S NOT ADEQUATE.
WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE MARKETING AND PROMOTION THAT IS
DONE THROUGH NEWSLETTERS, SOCIAL MEDIA EVENTS AND OTHER
ACTIVITIES IN LAKESIDE VILLAGE. WE WANT TO BE PART OF OSHA
BECAUSE THIS WILL BENEFIT OUR CHURCH AND OUR ENTIRE COMMUNITY
AND I HAVE TO SAY I'VE BEEN THERE ABOUT FOUR YEARS AND WHEN
I GOT THERE IT WAS A WINDSWEPT GRAY JUST BLEAK LANDSCAPE
AND NOW IT IS VIBRANT AND COLORFUL AND CLEAN AND JUST
AN EXCITING PLACE TO BE. SO LET'S VOTE YES AND THANK YOU
SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME. >> THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS.
>> WELCOME TO OUR NEXT SPEAKER .
>> THANK YOU. MY NAME IS KAT CYCLE I GUESS I HOPE I'M PRONOUNCING THAT CORRECTLY.
>> I'M HERE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE OCEAN AVENUE ASSOCIATION
AFTER WE STARTED THE BUSINESS COUNCIL IN 2021 WE DID A SURVEY
OF THE SMALL BUSINESSES AND THE NUMBER ONE PRIORITIES WERE
CLEAN, SAFE, BRIGHTLY LIT STREETS WITH HIGHER FOOTFALL OF
CUSTOMERS AND FEWER EMPTY BUILDINGS.
SO NO SURPRISES THERE. WHILE IT WAS QUITE EASY, DENISE
SPOKE TO THE WORK WE DID TO APPLY FOR GRANTS AS VOLUNTEERS
IT WAS QUITE EASY TO FIND GRANTS FOR NEW SHINY OBJECTS
LIKE MURALS OR A STAGE IN THE LITTLE COMMUNITY PARK WE CALLED
LAKESIDE LANDING. >> IT WAS REALLY HARD TO RAISE
THE MONEY FOR BASIC CLEANING SERVICES.
IN FACT IT TOOK US TWO YEARS SO REALLY HAPPY TO HEAR THE PEOPLE
THAT HAVE NOTICED THE DIFFERENCE.
JULY 2023 OKAY STARTED AND SINCE THE PARKS ALLIANCE
IMPLOSION WE REALLY MISS THEM SO I WANTED ALSO TO MENTION
THAT OKAY WITH A BEST VALUE WHEN WE GOT OUR GRANT WE WE
WENT OUT AND GOT QUOTES AND THEY WERE TWICE THE QUALITY
TWICE THE FREQUENCY FOR HALF THE PRICE.
SO I REALLY FEEL LIKE THIS IS A GOOD VALUE FOR THE PROPERTY
OWNERS AND I WANT TO READ A COUPLE OF QUOTES FROM PEOPLE
WHO COULDN'T BE HERE WHO ARE PROPERTY AND BUSINESS OWNERS.
ONE OF OUR PROPERTY OWNERS SAID WE WANT TO BE PART OF THE OKAY
BECAUSE THIS WILL BENEFIT OUR BUSINESS AS WELL AS THE ENTIRE
COMMERCIAL CORRIDOR AND MANY OTHERS. I WON'T READ THEM ALL HIGHLIGHTED HERE.
>> SO VOLUNTEERS AS DENISE SAID ,WE STILL ORGANIZE MONTHLY
CLEANUPS BECAUSE THE KIDS LOVE TO DO THEIR COMMUNITY SERVICE
BUT WE CAN'T POSSIBLY KEEP ON TOP OF A BUSY COMMERCIAL
CORRIDOR. SO WE URGE YOU TO VOTE YES FOR
CLEAN, SAFE, VIBRANT STREET AND WE HOPE THAT THE EXPANSION
WILL BE APPROVED. >> THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS. >> WELCOME TO OUR NEXT SPEAKER
. >> GOOD AFTERNOON BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. MY NAME IS HOWARD CHUNG.
>> I'M A LIFELONG SAN FRANCISCO RESIDENT AND A COMMERCIAL
PROPERTY OWNER. I OWNED THE PROPERTY AT FAXON AND OCEAN AVENUE IN SAN FRANCISCO.
>> I'VE ALSO BEEN A MEMBER OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE
OCEAN AVENUE ASSOCIATION SINCE ITS INCEPTION. >> SO AS A PROPERTY OWNER AND INVESTOR I LOOK VERY SIMPLY
AT THE AMOUNT OF THE ASSESSMENT VERSUS THE VALUE ADD THAT THE
OWNER BRINGS. AND I CAN SAY WHOLEHEARTEDLY
THAT I'VE ALWAYS SUPPORTED AND SUPPORT THE EXPANSION
AND RENEWAL OF THE OCEAN AVENUE ASSOCIATION THE WAY CLEAN
SIDEWALKS PICKS UP TRASH IN SHORT THE QUARTERS IS JUST A
LOT CLEANER. SECONDLY, THERE'S A CONSTANT
SAFETY AND COMMUNITY PRESENCE WITH THE WAY THAT TRANSLATES TO
WHAT I BELIEVE TO BE LESS CRIME AND PARTNERSHIP WITH SAPD
AND THE PERCEPTION OF LESS CRIME.
>> THE AIR IS ALSO A DRIVER OF ECONOMIC VITALITY AND BUSINESS
SUPPORT. THEY'VE SUPPORTED A NUMBER OF
GREAT EVENTS INCLUDING THE ART POP UP SERIES WINE TASTING AT
VARIOUS OCEAN AVENUE BUSINESSES AND LIVE MUSIC EVENTS.
AND ALSO THE SUPPORTS AND HOLDS BUSINESS ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS
AND ESPECIALLY ADVOCATES FOR CHINESE-AMERICAN OWNED
BUSINESSES IN THE AREA. >> I THINK THE AA IS THE I
THINK THE SMALLEST CBD BUT YET IT REALLY PUNCHES ABOVE ITS
WEIGHT IN TERMS OF GETTING GRANTS, GIVING BUSINESS
ASSISTANCE AND SHAPING PUBLIC POLICY FOR THE AREA.
>> SO I INVITE EACH OF THE MEMBERS OF THE BOARD OF
SUPERVISORS TO COME TO OCEAN AVENUE AND CHECK OUT THE
BUSINESSES THAT WE HAVE THERE. >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS. >> WELCOME TO OUR NEXT SPEAKER
. GOOD AFTERNOON. GOOD AFTERNOON TO THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS.
MY NAME IS HENRY COBAIN. I AM A RESIDENT OF WESTWOOD
PARK WHICH IS ADJACENT TO THE OCEAN AVENUE CORRIDOR.
I HAVE BEEN A MEMBER OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE OCEAN
AVENUE ASSOCIATION SINCE IT WAS FOUNDED IN 2010 AND I'M NOT
HERE TO REPEAT ALL THE THINGS YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT THE SERVICES
THAT THE CBD PROVIDES. USING THE ASSESSMENT DOLLARS I
WANT INSTEAD CALL YOUR ATTENTION TO ANOTHER ASPECT OF
THIS WONDERFUL ORGANIZATION AND THAT IS THE OCEAN AVENUE
ASSOCIATION ITSELF WHICH IS ALL VOLUNTEER NEIGHBORHOOD BASED,
COMMUNITY DRIVEN. AND SUPERVISOR MELGAR, YOU
EARLIER HAD THANKED SUPERVISE FOR APPLAUSE FOR ALL THE WORK
HE DID TO FOUND THIS CBD. >> HE DID IT WITH THE
INSPIRATION AND THE HELP OF OUR LEGENDARY COMMUNITY ACTIVIST
DAN WEAVER. AND I JUST WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE
AND RECOGNIZE THE SPIRIT OF DAN WEAVER AND ALL THAT HE STOOD
FOR IN MAKING THIS ORGANIZATION POSSIBLE.
LIVES ON. WE STILL ARE A VOICE OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD. WE STILL HOPE TO WORK WITH THE
CITY TO IMPROVE THE NEIGHBORHOOD. WE'RE HERE TO LISTEN. WE'RE HERE TO CONVEY
NEIGHBORHOOD FEELINGS BACK TO THE CITY.
AND THAT IS AS IMPORTANT AS THE USE OF THE ASSESSMENT DOLLARS
TO CLEAN, BEAUTIFY AND IMPROVE THE SAFETY OF THE CORRIDOR. SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR ATTENTION.
>> THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS AND WE WILL WELCOME THE NEXT
SPEAKER. ARE THERE ANY OTHER MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WHO WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS THE BOARD DURING THE
OCEAN AVENUE COMMUNITY BENEFIT DISTRICT PUBLIC HEARING?
ALL RIGHT. THIS WILL BE OUR LAST SPEAKER. WELCOME. >> HI EVERYONE.
MY NAME'S TIFFANY SINGH AND I AM A PROPERTY OWNER BUSINESS OWNER AND A BOARD DIRECTOR OF OCA.
AND I'M HERE TO STRONG TO URGE EVERYONE AND MY SEND MY STRONG
SUPPORT TO RENEWING THE OCEAN AVENUE ASSOCIATION.
OVER THE YEARS I HAVE BEEN PLAYING A KEY ROLE IN KEEPING
OUR CORRIDOR SAFE, VIBRANT AND THRIVING.
AND THIS RENEWAL ISN'T JUST IMPORTANT. IT'S NECESSARY FOR CONTINUED WELL-BEING FOR OUR
NEIGHBORHOOD. AND WITH THE RENEWAL AA CAN AA
CAN CONTINUE TO SUPPORT PUBLIC SAFETY THROUGH OUR PARTNERSHIP
WITH THE CITY'S AND ALSO WITH THE NEW OWNER.
IT WILL HELP SMALL BUSINESS MICE SURVIVE AND GROW WITH
RESOURCE TECHNICAL SUPPORT AND FUNDING SUPPORT AS WELL.
>> AND MOST IMPORTANTLY SERVING AS A STRONG UNIT AT WEISS OF
OCEAN AVENUE. WHEN WE SPEAK TO THE CITY
AND ADVOCATES FOR OUR COMMUNITY IT'S A WOUND IN A WAY IT'S MORE
THAN JUST A ORGANIZATION. IT IS A FORCE FOR CONNECTION ADVOCACY AND PROGRESS. I HOPE EVERYONE WITH STAND WITH
US IN SUPPORTING THIS RENEWAL AND WE CAN KEEP THE BUILDING
BETTER AND SAFE THAT BETTER SAFETY FOR OCEAN AVENUE AND FOR
THE NEIGHBORS. >> THANK YOU.
>> THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS. ALL RIGHT, MR. PRESIDENT.
>> ALL RIGHT. SEEING NO OTHER SPEAKERS PUBLIC COMMENT YEAH, I'D LIKE TO SPEAK FOR THE BOARD OF THAT HAD ALL
THESE ENORMOUS FIGURES. THOSE FIGURES ARE NOT THE TRUTH
. THE TRUTH IS THAT THAT COMMERCIAL DISTRICT OF OCEAN AVENUE HAS FROM FRIDA KAHLO
STREET TO EL REY 15 VACANT BUSINESS IS THAT HAVE AND TWO
OF THEM ONE IS A $50,000 15,000 SQUARE FOOT BUSINESS.
THE OTHER ONE IS AT LEAST 10,000 AND THERE WALGREENS HAS
LEFT. BUSINESSES ARE LEAVING
AND THEY'RE LEAVING BECAUSE NOT JUST THE ASSESSMENT THE
ASSESSMENT IS SOMETHING PILED ON TO EXCESSIVE TAXES, BUSINESS
TAX, PROPERTY TAXES. YOU HAVE TO BE REALISTIC.
YOU CAN'T DO BUSINESS IN A CITY THAT CONSTANTLY DRAINS THE
ECONOMY VITALITY THROUGH WHAT THEY CALL NONPROFITS.
THESE ARE NOT NONPROFITS. >> THEORY ARE CREATED TO CREATE
JOBS FOR HIGHLY EDUCATED, VERY CLEVER PEOPLE AND SEND OUT A
FEW PEOPLE TO CLEAN THE STREETS, PACK BAG THE BAGS
OUTSIDE AND THEN THEN PUBLIC WORKS COMES ALONG WITH THEIR
ARMY OF EMPLOYEES AND PICKS UP ALL THE GARBAGE.
THIS IS A BOONDOGGLE AND IF YOU WANT TO HELP LOWER THE TAXES,
RESTRICT THE ASSESSMENTS, STRIP PAINT AND RESTRICT THE YEARS
THAT THEY WANT AND THE IDEA THAT LAKESIDE VILLAGE IS GOING
TO BECOME PART OF THIS IS AN ABSOLUTE ABSURDITY A LAKESIDE
VILLAGE IS DIVIDED BY DUE TO PACIRA A VERY LARGE, VERY LARGE
DIFFICULT STREET TO GET ACROSS. >> THERE ARE TWO SEPARATE
ENTITIES THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I MEAN I COULD GO ON BUT I HEAR
THAT BUZZER THAT MUST MEAN MY TIME IS UP RIGHT.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. PLEASE THINK ABOUT WHAT I SAID
. >> YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY HELP BY LOWERING TAXES LOWING ASSESSMENT AND LOWERING
THE YEARS THAT THIS NONPROFIT IS BEEN.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS. MR. DUFFY ARE YOU HERE TO SPEAK
ON THE OCEAN AVENUE COMMUNITY BENEFIT DISTRICT? OKAY. WELCOME. I JUST CAN'T SEE IT ENDING ON THAT NOTE FROM THE COMMENT I
LIVE IN A NEIGHBORHOOD IN A FEW BLOCKS AWAY FROM HERE AND I
THINK IT'S JUST WONDERFUL PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO KEEP UP
THE QUALITY OF LIFE IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS AND I THINK IT'S
KIND OF ODD THAT THE FUNDING FOR THE QUALITY OF LIFE IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD IS UNDER ATTACK RIGHT NOW.
THE OTHER THING I WOULD SAY IS THAT IF WE'RE GOING TO HAVE SUCH LARGE ADULT PEOPLE TALKING HERE, MAYBE THERE COULD BE AN
EXTENSION FOR THE FOR THE MICROPHONE FOR THE LARGER PEOPLE. >> THANK YOU.
MR. DUFFY ARE THERE ANY OTHER MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WHO WOULD
LIKE TO ADDRESS THE BOARD ON THE OCEAN AVENUE COMMUNITY BENEFIT DISTRICT? >> PLEASE COME FORWARD, SIR.

ALSO AROUND THE THREE CAN YOU USE THE MICROPHONES OR SPEAK
INTO THE MICROPHONE SO EVERYWHERE YOU JUST SPEAK UP
MACDONALD THING AND UNDER THE TREES LEAVES IT'S ACCUMULATED
ON THE STREET OCEAN AND THEN ANOTHER CIRCUIT TO USE THE

JOB BUT I TALK TO THAT GUY AND ANOTHER GUY THEY SHOULD

NO SIGN OF WHAT PUBLIC WORKS OR ASSOCIATION UNIFORM YELLOW.
YES, I SAID YELLOW AND OH DOESN'T NOT NATIONAL PUBLIC
WORKS JUMP AND THEN I TALKED TO THE SAME GUY AGAIN ONE TIME

THE STREET SO THAT'S THE PROBLEM.
I DON'T HAVE TO LISTEN OUTDOOR GUY IN LOS YES MAYBE BUT I
JUST WANT TO SAY SOMETHING ABOUT BECAUSE I'M CLEANING MY
OWN AREA AND I COULD GO TIMES ALREADY BUT JUST TRIPPIN.

>> GOOD AFTERNOON. I'M ALISHA ROCHELLE.
I AM AN AMERICAN. AMERICANS ARE CITIZENS OF THE
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. >> FEDERAL LAW DOES NOT EQUATE
NATIONALITY WITH RACE OR ETHNICITY BUT RATHER WITH
CITIZENSHIP. THE MAJORITY OF AMERICANS OR
THEIR ANCESTORS IMMIGRATED TO THE UNITED STATES OR ARE
DESCENDANTS FROM PEOPLE WHO ARE BROUGHT AS SLAVES WITHIN THE
PAST FIVE CENTURIES. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE
NATIVE AMERICAN POPULATION. SO THE ADJECTIVE DISENFRANCHIZE
DESCRIBES A PERSON OR GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO ARE STRIPPED OF
THEIR POWER LIKE DISENFRANCHIZE POST-CIVIL WAR AFRICAN
AMERICANS WHO WERE DEPRIVED OF THEIR RIGHT TO VOTE EVEN AFTER BEING FREED FROM SAY SLAVERY. BEING DISENFRANCHIZED IS NO
FUN. THE RULES WORK AGAINST YOU. YOUR RIGHTS ARE CONSTANTLY VIOLATED AND YOU HAVE LITTLE
POWER TO CHANGE YOUR LIFE FOR THE BETTER.
THE OLD FRENCH WORD IN FRENCH HERE MEANS TO MAKE FREE.
AND WHEN YOU ADD THE NEGATIVE PREFIX DIS DISENFRANCHIZE MEANS
MADE UNFREE A DISENFRANCHIZE POPULATION DOESN'T REST EASY
AND OFTEN THEY ORGANIZE AND FIGHT BACK AGAINST THEIR
CONDITION TO DEMAND THEIR BASIC RIGHTS AND FREEDOM.
THAT'S HOW WE WANT OUR BASIC RIGHTS AND FREEDOM.
WE ARE ALSO SAN FRANCISCANS LOVE ON YOUR SAN FRANCISCANS.
I'M NOT FEELING THE LOVE AS A BLACK WOMAN, AS AN
AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMAN, AS AN AMERICAN. THIS IS WHERE I'M CHOOSING TO LIVE.
MAKE ME FEEL COMFORTABLE HERE. THANK YOU.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS, SIR.
>> I DID YOU ALREADY PROVIDE GENERAL PUBLIC COMMENT?
>> NO, NOT ON THIS. NO. OKAY. ALL RIGHT. >> WELL, WELCOME. THANK YOU. APPRECIATE YOU GETTING GOOD AFTERNOON.
BOARD OF SUPERVISORS CHAIR. MY NAME AGAIN. MY NAME IS LAUREN DE STERLING AND I'M A PROUD MEMBER OF SAN
FRANCISCO'S BLACK BUSINESS COMMUNITY AND SAN FRANCISCO
BLACK COMMUNITY. I'M HERE TO URGE THIS BOARD TO
CONTINUE INVESTING IN BLACK COMMUNITIES BECAUSE THE NEED IS
URGING AND THE IMPACT IS REAL. FOR DECADES BLACK NEIGHBORHOODS
HAVE BEEN SYSTEMATICALLY AND UNDERFUNDED WHILE OUR
BUSINESSES FIGHT FOR SURVIVAL WITH LIMITED ACCESS TO CAPITAL
CONTRACTS AND OPPORTUNITIES. WE'RE NOT ASKING FOR FAVORS.
WE'RE ASKING FOR FAIR INVESTMENT IN COMMUNITIES THAT
HAVE GIVEN SO MUCH TO THIS CITY. WHEN WE FUND BLACK OWNED BUSINESSES, WE'RE NOT JUST
SUPPORTING ENTREPRENEURS. WE'RE CREATING JOBS, PRESERVING
CULTURE, STABILIZING FAMILIES AND BUILDING LONG TERM WEALTH
IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS THAT NEED IT.
THAT NEED IN MOST EQUITY IS NOT ACHIEVED WITH STATEMENTS IT'S
ACHIEVED WITH BUDGETS. AND I WANT TO CLOSE WITH THIS.
WE DO NOT WANT TO ROLL BACK THE HARD WON GAINS THAT WERE MADE.
THOSE INVESTMENTS SAVED LIVES, CREATED JOBS AND BROUGHT
DIGNITY TO COMMUNITIES THAT HAD LONG BEEN DENIED IT.
TO ABANDON THEM NOW IS TO WALK AWAY FROM THE COMMITMENTS MADE
DURING THE CITY'S SO-CALLED RACIAL RECKONING.
BUDGETS ARE MORAL DOCUMENTS. THEY REVEAL WHAT AND WHO WE
TRULY VALUE. WE URGE THIS BOARD TO PROVE
THAT YOUR PROMISES WERE MORE THAN SYMBOLIC. UPLIFT THE BLACK COMMUNITY, DELIVER ON EQUITY AND DO WHAT'S
THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS. SOLILOQUY A CHANDLER ONCE AGAIN
AND I'M REALLY KIND OF CONFUSED CONCERNING THE PROPOSITION 209
THAT STATES THAT NO COMMUNITY CAN RECEIVE FUNDING IN THE NAME
OF OUR RACE. >> IT'S INTERESTING TO ME THAT
THE SANCTUARY CITY WAS ABLE TO RECEIVE MILLIONS AND MILLIONS
OF DOLLARS. THE ASIAN COMMUNITY WAS ABLE TO
RECEIVE MONEY IN THE NAME OF ASIAN HATE.
I'M REALLY CONFUSED HERE THE APA WHICH IS THE ASIAN PACIFIC.
THEY HAVE THE ASIAN FAMILY SUPPORT SERVICE, ASIAN HERITAGE
FOUNDATION, ASIAN CULTURAL CENTER, ASIAN LEGAL OUTREACH,
ASIAN INC ASIAN LOCAL CAUCUS ASIAN PACIFIC AMERICAN AMERICAN
COMMUNITY CENTER BE CHINATOWN BRIGHT LINE DEFENSE PROJECT
CENTER FOR ASIAN AMERICAN MEDIA CHARITY CULTURAL SERVICES
CHINATOWN ASIAN COMMUNITY CHILDREN'S CENTER CHINATOWN
COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT CHINATOWN TOWN M.K. YMCA CHINESE CULTURAL
CENTER OF SAN FRANCISCO. CHINESE FOR AFFIRMATIVE ACTION
CHINESE HISTORICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA CHINESE NEWCOMERS
SERVICE CENTER CHINESE PROGRESSIVES ASSOCIATION
CHINATOWN MILLION ARTS COLLABORATIVE COALITION FOR
COMMUNITY SAFETY AND JUSTICE ON AND ON AND ON AND ON.
>> WHAT'S GOING ON AROUND HERE? WHAT IS THE DECEPTION GOING ON
AROUND HERE THAT YOU TAKE 60 MILLION THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE FOR THE BLACK COMMUNITY AND GIVE IT TO EVERYBODY WHO'S
NOT WORKING WITH THE BLACK COMMUNITY WHO WE DON'T KNOW WHO
THEY ARE, THE EVIL AND THE WICKEDNESS THAT YOU'RE DOING A
VANEGAS MINE SAY OF YOUR WELL OR HIM AND YOU'RE GOING TO REAP WHAT YOU SOW. I'M JUST HERE TO WARN EVERY ONE OF YOU TO DECEITFULNESS THAT YOU HAVE BEEN PLANNED ALL THESE
YEARS IS NOW COMING BACK TO HAUNT YOU.
>> THE BLACK SAYING NEVER ASKS FOR MUCH MORE LATER.
>> DAISY TOO. THANK YOU SALAH THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS. >> LET'S HEAR FROM OUR NEXT
SPEAKER. THANK YOU SALAH.
>> I THANK YOU SALAH. WELCOME, MR. KLEIN.
IT WILL COME AND COLLECT THAT FROM YOU.
>> GOOD AFTERNOON, BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. FOR THE RECORD MY NAME IS CHRISTOPHER KLEIN.
I ALSO GO BY SERGEANT KLEIN OF THE UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS
. SO I'M HANDING OUT A SURVEILLANCE OVERVIEW FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS COUPLE OF
MONTHS. THIS IS GOING TO BE THE NUMBER ONE TOPIC THAT EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM IS GOING TO BE DEALING
WITH. I'M KIND OF BROKE IT DOWN NAME
VARIATIONS, DIGITAL SURVEILLANCE, HEALTH SURVEILLANCE, GANG SURVEILLANCE, PRISONS
SURVEILLANCE AND SO ON AND SO ON. THE CDC ACCEPTABLE GUIDELINES FOR SURVEILLANCE IS BRIEF
AND NOT LONG LASTING AND NOT TO IMPEDE A PERSON'S FINANCIAL
EDUCATION AND OR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.
THERE'S ISSUES WITH SYNERGY STACKING OF SURVEILLANCE JUST
AN EXAMPLE OF STACKING IS I WAS BORN IN PENNSYLVANIA SO PENN
STATE THINKS THAT THEY OWN MY HEALTH CARE. I GREW UP IN MARYLAND. AMERICAN UNIVERSITY UNIVERSITY
OF MARYLAND THINKS THEY OWN MY HEALTH CARE. I MOVED TO SAN FRANCISCO, WORKED IN LA, UCSF, UCLA.
THEY THINK THEY OWN MY HEALTH CARE SO I HAVE LIKE 9 OR 10
COMPETING HEALTH CARES. AND THAT CREATES A STACKING.
SO WHEN SOMEBODY WANTS TO DO AN INTERVIEW OR A QUESTIONNAIRE AT NIGHT THERE'S NO TIME. SO AT 1:00 THEY COME IN WITH
THEIR INTERVIEW. AND IT KEEPS PEOPLE UP SOME
PEOPLE TO GET OVER THAT THEY WANT TO GET UP AND HAVE A DRINK OR MAYBE THEY DO DRUGS OR WHATEVER TO DEAL WITH THAT.
THAT CREATES OVERDOSES AND SUICIDES.
SO AGAIN, THIS IS JUST A HANDOUT BUT WE'RE RECOMMENDING
THAT THE DEPARTMENT HEADS CONVENE AN EMERGENCY MEETING TO
DETERMINE APPROPRIATE HIERARCHY OF SURVEILLANCE NEED IT
NECESSITY OF A PERSON'S HEALTH CARE OVER OTHER EXISTING ISSUES
,COURT ORDERS GOOD OF PUBLIC HEALTH SAFETY WITH RESPECT TO A PERSON'S PRIVACY AND TO ELIMINATE EXCESSIVE NOISE FROM
THIRD PARTIES SUCH AS OTHER CITIES, COUNTIES, STATES, UNIVERSITIES AND FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS BOTH FRIENDLY
AND ADVERSARY ADVERSARIES. AND MY CONTACT INFORMATION IS
THERE FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IF YOU NEED ASSISTANCE AND WE HAVE TO GET THROUGH THIS WE HAVE TO DO A
BETTER JOB OF ELIMINATING THE NOISE AND EXTERNAL SURVEILLANCE
FROM OTHER AREAS OTHER CITIES, UNIVERSITIES AND FOREIGN
COUNTRIES. THANK YOU.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS. NEXT SPEAKER GOOD AFTERNOON
SUPERVISORS. MY NAME IS STEPHANIE PINKHAM.
I'M A FIFTH GENERATION SAN FRANCISCAN AND I HAVE RENTED MY
CURRENT HOME FOR THE PAST 20 YEARS. I'M HERE TODAY TO ASK WHAT IS THE POINT OF A RESTRAINING
ORDER IF NO ONE WILL ENFORCE IT?
I HAVE BOTH A CIVIL HARASSMENT RESTRAINING ORDER AND A
CRIMINAL PROTECTIVE ORDER AGAINST MY NEIGHBOR PRESTON MARX. HE VIOLATES SOME DAILY ENTERING
RESTRICTED AREAS THREATENING ME ,STALKING ME AND RELENTLESSLY
HARASSING ME AND MY DOGS. I REPORT THESE VIOLATIONS BUT
SFPD REFUSES TO ARREST THEM. I'VE BEEN TOLD RESTRAINING
ORDERS ARE JUST CIVIL MATTERS. THE OFFICERS HAVE MORE
IMPORTANT THINGS TO DO THAT THEY'RE SHORT STAFFED OR BUSY
AND THAT UNLESS THERE'S GRAVE BODILY INJURY THEY WON'T ARREST
. IT'S CLEAR MANY OFFICERS VIEW THESE VIOLATIONS AS A DISTRACTION FROM REAL CRIMES
EVEN WORSE. MANY OFFICERS DON'T KNOW HOW TO
READ RESTRAINING ORDERS. I'VE HAD TO POINT OUT KEY TERMS
ONLY TO BE TOLD THE COURT ISSUED FORMS ARE UNCLEAR.
OFFICERS ALSO DON'T SEEM TO UNDERSTAND THE CONTROLLING PRIORITY OF THE CPO. >> ON MULTIPLE OCCASIONS
OFFICERS HAVE TOLD ME TO GO BACK TO COURT AND GET A BETTER
ORDER. >> BUT WHEN I GO TO COURT I'M
TOLD THE POLICE ARE NOT DOING THEIR JOB.
THIS IS AN IMPOSSIBLE SITUATION AS A VICTIM.
OFFICERS SAY THEIR JOB IS TO DE-ESCALATE BUT THAT DOESN'T PROTECT VICTIMS. ACCOUNTABILITY DOES.
THIS ISN'T JUST ABOUT ME. >> COURT RECORDS SHOW MULTIPLE
ADDITIONAL RESTRAINING ORDERS ALONG WITH PENDING CIVIL
AND CRIMINAL MATTERS REGARDING MR. WORKS. THIS IS NOT A PRIVATE CONFLICT. IT'S A PUBLIC SAFETY FAILURE
PLAYING OUT IN REAL TIME IN A CITY THAT CLAIMS TO PROTECT
TENANTS AND VULNERABLE RESIDENTS. AS THE CITY'S LEGISLATIVE LEADERSHIP YOU ARE ALL
RESPONSIBLE FOR PUBLIC SAFETY AND THIS IS WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE
WHEN THAT PROMISE BREAKS DOWN. A RESIDENT STANDING BEFORE YOU
BEGGING FOR ACTION, BEGGING FOR POLICE AND PROSECUTORS TO BE
GIVEN THE MANDATE, THE TRAINING, THE STAFFING AND THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO ENFORCE COURT ORDERS SO THAT I
AND OTHERS LIKE ME DO NOT HAVE TO LIVE IN CONSTANT FEAR.
>> THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS .
>> I'M GOING TO TELL YOU SOMETHING QUITE REMARKABLE.
YOU SHOULD READ A BOOK CALLED THE LIGHT AND THE GLORY BY PETER MARSHALL AND IT JUST TALKS ABOUT THE HAND OF GOD ON
OUR NATION AND IT'S IN DANIEL WE READ ABOUT 2300 YEARS AND IF
YOU START THE 2300 YEARS FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE TIMES
IN THE GENTILES REMEMBER I TOLD YOU WHEN TRUMP MADE HIS
PROCLAMATION IT WAS 360 SABBATICAL CYCLES AND 360
MONTHS FROM THE START OF THE TIMES OF THE GENTILES. >> IT'S STRANGE BECAUSE IT WAS 2300 YEARS TO 1776 NOBODY
EVIDENTLY KNEW THAT BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T ADJUST THE
CHRONOLOGY TO THE YEAR THAT CHRIST WAS BAPTIZED. IT'S A VERY SOLID YEAR IN LUKE CHAPTER THREE.
IT WAS THE 15TH OF TIBERIUS CAESAR.
>> IT WAS 28 A.D. ON THE GREGORIAN CALENDAR AND IT WAS
THE END OF THE 69TH WEEK OF DANIEL. IF YOU KNOW THE PROPHECY IN DANIEL NINE.
>> I'VE MEMORIZED IT. IT'S POWERFUL. IT'S THERE WERE 69 SYMBIOTIC CYCLES FROM CYRUS TO THE
ANOINTING OF CHRIST WHICH WAS 28 A.D. THAT MEANS BACKING UP
70 YEARS OR TEN SABBATICAL CYCLES FROM THE START OF THE
TIMES OF THE GENTILES WHEN THE BABYLONIANS DESTROYED THE THE
TEMPLE YOU HAD 79 WEEKS OR 550 THREE YEARS DO THE MATH 1776
IT'S AMAZING WAS 2300 YEARS. >> THIS IS TRULY THE BOOK OF
DANIEL. YOU'VE HEARD OF DANIEL, RIGHT?
>> I MEAN HE REALLY YOU SHOULD READ THAT BOOK THE THE FIRST
REFERENCE THAT CHRIST SAID WAS OUT OF HIS MOUTH WAS A
REFERENCE TO THAT INCREDIBLE BOOK THE TIME IS FULFILLED.
HE WAS TALKING ABOUT THERE BEING 69 WEEKS 483 YEARS
AND HERE'S SOMETHING THAT'S STRANGE.
483 YEARS IS 176,411 DAYS BUT 490 YEARS IF YOU USE THE 360
DAY CALENDAR IT'S THE SAME THING.
IT'S 176,400 DAYS BASICALLY THE SAME THING.
>> EVERYONE SHOULD BE CORRECTED AND THERE'S NO REASON FOR IT.
>> ALL RIGHT. SO LET'S HEAR FROM OUR NEXT SPEAKER. PLEASE PLEASE COME FORWARD.
>> GOOD AFTERNOON. ELECTED MEMBERS OF THE SAN
FRANCISCO BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. MY NAME IS GERALDINE ANDERSON.
I'M A DEDICATED VETERAN CITY AND COUNTY EMPLOYEE FOR OVER 36
YEARS OF SERVICE AND THE AUTHOR OF TWO EMAILS WRITTEN TO
CHAIRWOMAN OF THE BUDGET AND FINANCE COMMITTEE SUPERVISOR CHAN IN A SHARED EMAIL TO MAYOR LURIE AND THE
REST OF THE BOARD. I RESPECTFULLY COME BEFORE YOU
TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE MOST SENIOR STAFF 42 EMPLOYEES TO BE
EXACT OF THE SAN FRANCISCO'S SUPERIOR COURT WHOSE
EMPLOYMENT, TENURE AND RETIREMENT BENEFITS ARE
MONITORED AND CONTROLLED BY THIS GREAT CITY. I'M HOPEFUL ALL OF YOU HAVE RECEIVED THE PACKET I FILED ON
JULY 3RD WITH THIS OFFICE REQUESTING FOR A CONSIDERATION OF A VOLUNTARY RETIREMENT INCENTIVE.
I MAKE THIS STATEMENT THIS VOLUNTEER FREE RETIREMENT
INCENTIVE WOULD ALLOW FOR A COST SAVINGS FOR THE COURT,
AVOID UNNECESSARY FURLOUGHS OR LAYOFFS AND MOST IMPORTANTLY
CONTINUING AND DELAYED PUBLIC ACCESS TO OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM.
I HUMBLY PRAY THIS CITY LEADERSHIP WILL CHAMPION THIS
REQUEST AND RECOGNIZE OUR EFFORTS IN PRESERVING THE CIVIC
INFRASTRUCTURE OUR COURTS PROVIDE.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. >> THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS. NEXT SPEAKER. >> OH, HI.
I'M MARY RICK PERRY AND I'M PROBABLY SORT OF THE SUPERIOR
COURT OF SAN FRANCISCO OVER 18 YEARS.
I STRONGLY SUPPORT THE IMPLEMENTATION SHOT OF THE
THREE PLUS THREE VOLUNTARY RETIREMENT INCENTIVE.
>> THIS PROPOSAL PRESENTS A FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE SOLUTION
THAT ALIGNS WITH OUR SHARED COMMITMENT TO PRESERVING PUBLIC
SERVICES WHILE ADDRESSING BUDGETARY CONSTRAINTS.
BY OFFERING THIS INCENTIVE, THE COURT CAN ACHIEVE MEANINGFUL
COST SAVINGS, PREVENT DISRUPTIVE PAULOSE OR LAYOFFS
AND MOST IMPORTANTLY ENSURE UNINTERRUPTED PUBLIC ACCESS TO
JUSTICE. IT IS A STRONG TEACHING
INVESTMENT IN BOTH THE WELL-BEING OF DEDICATED STAFF
AND THE COMMUNITIES WE SERVE. I URGE YOU TO CONSIDER THIS
PROPOSAL AS A PROACTIVE STEP TOWARD STABILIZING OUR
WORKFORCE AND MAINTAINING THE INTEGRITY OF OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM
. >> THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS. ARE THERE ANY OTHER MEMBERS OF
THE PUBLIC TO ADDRESS THE BOARD DURING GENERAL PUBLIC COMMENT?
PLEASE STEP UP. THIS MAY BE OUR LAST SPEAKER. WELCOME SIR. >> THANK YOU.
BOARD MEMBERS AND BOARD PRESIDENT THERE'S A REAL COLD
WIND COMING FROM WASHINGTON AND D.C. AND IT'S FLAMING.
OUR STATE PARTICULARLY LOS ANGELES AS YOU'VE SEEN THE NEWS
. AND I REALLY DON'T THINK THAT THE PEOPLE IN SAN FRANCISCO ARE PREPARED FOR WHAT POTENTIALLY
IS COMING. THE LOS ANGELES EVENTS ARE
SIMPLY A PRACTICE IN FACT. WHILE YOU ALL THINK THAT
SANCTUARY CITY IS GOING TO SAVE YOU, IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO BE
A FIGHT, FIGHT, FIGHT. SO YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE
AS I SAID LAST WEEK SOME KIND OF COMPROMISES TO KEEP FIGHTING
. I READ IN THE NEWSPAPER THIS
MAY BE A SIGN OF THE TIMES THAT A BANK EMPLOYEE WAS ARRESTED
FOR FOR EXTORTING RATHER EMBEZZLING $500,000 WHICH IS
HALF $1 MILLION. >> BUT WHAT WAS INTERESTING ABOUT THAT ARTICLE THAT THE BANK ITSELF WAS NOT NAMED.
IS THAT AN INFLUENCE OF THE THINGS THAT WERE GOING TO SEE
IN THE FUTURE? ANOTHER ONE THAT KIND OF NOTED
ME IN A NOTE MADE I NOTED WAS THE DIVISIVENESS THAT OUR
DISTRICTS ARE HAVING IN CARVING OUT SPECIAL ZONES FOR EACH
OTHER. FOR EXAMPLE THE NORTH BEACH
ZONE THIS IS PROBABLY A LEGACY FROM OUR LAST SUPERVISOR
PRESIDENT AARON PESKIN AND OF COURSE THE MISSION 24TH STREET
WHICH IS ANOTHER SHORT ZONE BUT A SPECIAL DISTRICT.
WE CAN'T HAVE THESE SPECIAL DISTRICTS.
WE'VE GOT TO GET UNITED UNITED WE STAND, DIVIDED WE FALL.
>> THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS .
ALL RIGHT. WELCOME, SIR. ARE YOU OUR LAST SPEAKER? EXCUSE ME.
>> IS THE SUBJECT OF OCEAN AVENUE CLOSED? NO, THIS IS NOT ABOUT THE OCEAN AVENUE CBD.
THIS IS GENERAL PUBLIC COMMENT. I CAN COMMENT ON OCEAN AVENUE.
>> NO, SIR. OKAY. THANK YOU. >> ALL RIGHT, MR. PRESIDENT.
ALL RIGHT. PUBLIC COMMENT IS NOW CLOSED.
>> WE ARE GOING TO SKIP OVER THE CLOSED SESSION ITEM 45 FOR
NOW AND CALL IT UP AT THE END OF OUR AGENDA.
MADAM CLERK, LET'S GO TO OUR FOR ADOPTION OF THAT COMMITTEE
REFERENCE. >> AGENDA ITEMS 46 THROUGH 50
ITEMS 46 THROUGH 50 WERE INTRODUCED FOR ADOPTION BUT WITHOUT COMMITTEE REFERENCE A UNANIMOUS VOTE IS REQUIRED FOR
ADOPTION OF A RESOLUTION ON FIRST READING TODAY.
ALTERNATIVELY, A MEMBER MAY REQUIRE A RESOLUTION ON FIRST
READING TO GO TO COMMITTEE. >> SUPERVISOR WALTON THANK YOU MR. PRESIDENT. I LIKE THE CIVIL 49 AND 54 950
ARE SEVERED AND MADAM CLERK CAN YOU OKAY.
>> SUPERVISOR DORSEY 47 AND 47. SO, MADAM CLERK, CAN YOU PLEASE

CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND BLUE SHIELD OF CALIFORNIA TO RESOLVE

SERVICES. >> SUPERVISOR DORSEY, THANK YOU
PRESIDENT RANDLEMAN COLLEAGUES EARLIER THIS AFTERNOON LITERALLY MOMENTS AFTER CONFIRMING THAT THIS RESOLUTION
ENJOYED THE UNANIMOUS CO-SPONSORSHIP OF THIS BOARD,
MY OFFICE RECEIVED WORD FROM THE SAN FRANCISCO HEALTH
SERVICE SYSTEM WHOSE BOARD I SERVE ON THAT THE DISPUTE BETWEEN UC HEALTH AND BLUE SHIELD OF CALIFORNIA THAT WE
WERE URGING TO BE RESOLVED HAS IN FACT BEEN RESOLVED.
SO THIS IS OBVIOUSLY GREAT NEWS FOR THE CITY WORKERS
AND RETIREES AND NO SMALL NUMBER OF OUR CONSTITUENTS WHO
WILL NOT BE LOSING ACCESS TO UCSF DOCTORS AND SERVICES.
I WOULD LIKE TO THINK THAT THIS HAPPENED PRECISELY BECAUSE OF
OUR UNANIMITY. BUT EVEN IF THAT'S NOT THE
CASE, YOUR SUPPORT CERTAINLY DIDN'T HURT THE BLUE SHIELD.
UC'S CONTRACT WILL BE RENEWED, THEREBY CONTINUING TO PRESERVE
MEMBERS ABILITY TO ACCESS CRUCIAL HEALTH CARE SERVICES.
I WANT TO THANK ALL COLLEAGUES ESPECIALLY SUPERVISORS MELGAR

TRAFFIC IMMUNITY TO STAY ALIVE AS WELL AS ALL OF THE FOLKS WHO
WILL BE AFFECTED BY TRAFFIC TRYING TO GET HOME ON A DAILY.
IF THE CITY IS GOING TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS PROJECT WE
NEED TO STEP UP NOW WITH REAL RELIEF SO THESE BUSINESSES CAN
MAKE IT THROUGH JUST LIKE HOW WE PROVIDE A RELIEF FOR THE
TERRIBLE L PROJECT, THE PROJECT ON VENICE AND DURING THE
PANDEMIC IF WE CAN FUND AND BUILD CLIMATE RESILIENT
INFRASTRUCTURE LIKE THE LAST BRIDGE, WE CAN ALSO FUND
RESILIENCE FOR OUR LOCAL ECONOMIES AND WORKING CLASS NEIGHBORHOODS. THANK YOU FOR JOINING ME
