### **Project Name:** SFGovTV Insights (or something similar)

### **Core Problem & User Pain Points**

The general public finds SFGovTV's 3-4 hour-long meeting videos inaccessible. They lack the time and patience to find the main topics, speakers, or key moments. This results in a lack of civic engagement and transparency.

### **Our Solution: An AI-Powered, User-Friendly Platform**

We will create a platform that transforms raw SFGovTV video data into a highly searchable, scannable, and engaging user experience. The key is to deliver value by providing structured, easy-to-digest information.

### **Project Roadmap & Features**

This is a step-by-step plan for your hackathon project, broken down by user-facing features.

### **Feature 1: AI-Powered Search & Discovery (Your MVP)**

This is the most critical feature and the foundation of the project.

- **How it Works:** The user lands on a page with a simple search bar. They type in a person's name, a keyword ("public transportation funding"), or a phrase ("how to deal with housing crisis"). The search results show relevant video clips, complete with a short summary and the speaker's name.
- **Technical Implementation:**
    - **Data Ingestion:** You will need to download a few sample videos from SFGovTV's Video on Demand service.
    - **Transcription:** Use an AI transcription service (like AssemblyAI, Descript, or OpenAI's Whisper) to turn the video's audio into a transcript with timestamps.
    - **Embeddings & Vector Store:** Convert the transcript text into a numerical format (embeddings) and store it in a vector database. This is what enables the "semantic search" that understands the meaning, not just keywords.

### **Feature 2: Dynamic Summaries & Topic Highlighting**

This feature directly addresses the "long and dry" user pain point.

- **How it Works:** Instead of a long transcript, the platform shows an AI-generated summary of the video. It would also have a list of key topics discussed, which the user can click to jump to the relevant part of the video. The user will be able to see a "Highlights" reel of the most important moments.
- **Technical Implementation:**
    - **AI Summarization:** Use a language model (like the ones from OpenAI or Hugging Face) to process the full transcript and generate a concise summary.
    - **Topic Modeling:** Use natural language processing (NLP) to identify the key topics in each video segment and create a clickable list.

### **Feature 3: Person and Attribution Index**

This is the feature that provides accountability and context.

- **How it Works:** When a user is watching a video, a sidebar would show who is speaking in real-time, along with their title (e.g., "Mayor London Breed"). The user can click on a person's name to see a summary of their contributions to the meeting.
- **Technical Implementation:**
    - **Named-Entity Recognition (NER):** Use an NER model to scan the transcripts and identify names and their associated titles.
    - **Speaker Diarization:** Most modern transcription services can automatically label speakers ("Speaker 1," "Speaker 2"). Your team can then use NER to match "Speaker 1" to "Mayor London Breed."

### **User-Friendly Design (A Product Designer's Dream)**

This is where your design skills come in. The user interface needs to be clean, intuitive, and modern.

- **Design Principles:**
    - **Visual-First:** Use a visually appealing, scrollable timeline with thumbnails to represent different parts of the video.
    - **Search-First:** The main screen should be a simple search bar, not a cluttered video library.
    - **Clarity over Density:** Avoid overwhelming the user with a long text transcript. Instead, show a summary, a list of topics, and an index of people.

This roadmap breaks down the project into achievable, feature-based goals. The key is to start with the data ingestion and transcription, as that will be the raw material for everything else. Are you ready to start building?
